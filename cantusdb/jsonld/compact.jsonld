        "source_description": "It is quite clear that the monastery was under the influence of the Hirsau reform.  See article by Janka Szendrei in bibliography; the comparison with south German sources, such as the Zwiefalten antiphoner (Karlsruhe, Badische Landesbibliothek - Musikabteilung, Aug. LX), seems to confirm it.\n*It is problematic that this antiphoner contains almost no rubrics.*  For example, the distribution of antiphons for the weekdays is not clear.  It is evident, however, from the size of the initials that the chants are organized, and are not merely unstructured lists of items.  The initials suggest a distribution of items for individual days of the week even when there are no explicit rubrics.  Since the Office of the St. George monastery is well documented \u2013 it is one of the most numerous manuscript collections in Czech libraries \u2013 concordances have been located in two breviaries from the same \u00e9poque: (See online images of these breviaries in the Manuscriptorium digital library: http://www.manuscriptorium.com/apps/main/en/index.php)\n1. The breviary of Kunegunda of Kolovraty, a nun who commanded the manuscript between 1365 and 1385, shortly before she became abbess of the St. George Monastery. Shelfmark: Prague, N\u00e1rodn\u00ed knihovna (National Library), XIII E 14a.\nClick (as of 2012): http://www.manuscriptorium.com/apps/main/index.php?request=show_record_n...\n2.  Shelfmark: Prague, N\u00e1rodn\u00ed knihovna (National Library), XIII C 1a\nClick (as of 2012): http://www.manuscriptorium.com/apps/main/en/index.php?request=show_recor...\nComparison with these two breviaries has enabled interpretation of the St. George monastery antiphoner in some ambiguous situations.\nThe differentiae of each mode have been numbered with a two-digit system: an upper-case letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and a sequentially-ordered numeral.",

Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

BKT.006 (the \u2018Tsgrooten Antiphoner\u2019) was commissioned in 1522 by Antonius Tsgrooten, abbot of the Premonstratensian abbey of Tongerlo, located in the province of Antwerp. The manuscript is a summer volume, holding the chants for the divine office from Easter up until the Sunday before Advent. The corresponding winter volume\u2014with chants from Advent to Holy Week\u2014is in the British Library (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15427). Also commissioned in 1522 was a hymnary (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15426). These three manuscripts are all of similar dimensions, compilation structures, and styles. \n\nAll three manuscripts are of interest for the illuminated miniatures and border flourishing, executed in the Ghent-Bruges style, with particularly elaborate border pages for key feasts. The scribe responsible for the manuscripts, Franciscus van Weert, was a prolific copyist for other Premonstratensian manuscripts, including those at the nearby abbeys of Park and Averbode. \n\nB-Gu, Hs. BKT.006\u2014along with its companion volumes\u2014was heavily edited in the seventeenth century to adhere more consistently with Premonstratensian chant reform. These editorial changes accord with other manuscripts from the order, and conform with the new edition of the Antiphonarium Praemonstratense published by Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers (Paris, 1680). These changes manifest in the erasures of older notes and text, and overwriting in a newer hand. Some chants and rubrics are struck through entirely, whereas new additions and notes are inserted interlinearly or in available margin space.\n\nPrior to the abbey\u2019s dissolution during the French Revolution, the manuscript was gifted to the House of Merode. The Flemish Government bought the manuscript in 2008, after which it was brought to its current home at the Universiteit Gent.",

        "source_description": "Since Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

Although an important Premonstratensian manuscript of the Jurassian region, it is likely that the manuscript originated from north-eastern France and was a gift to Bellelay Abbey at its founding. To that effect, the Messine notation is not typical of the Jurassian region, and the manuscript includes many erasures and corrections suggesting adaptation to local practice. Furthermore, only one saint in the Sanctorale is particular to the Jurassian region, St. Imer (Imier), and even this seems to be a later addition from the beginning of the 13th century. The manuscript may have been a gift from the mother house of Lac de Joux Abbey, itself a sister abbey to Saint-Martin de Laon in north-eastern France. ",

Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

        "source_description": "<p>This book forms part of the &quot;opus tripartitum&quot; (including a gradual [1536] and a noted ferial psalter [1537] , that the Cologne printer Hero Alopecius (Fuchs) produced for the diocese of M\u00fcnster after the Anabaptists had destroyed many liturgical books in the city during their &quot;kingdom of a thousand years&quot; in 1534-35. It is a rich source of historia with plainchant texts and melodies that are unique, or nearly unique, to antiphoners and noted breviaries written for use in the diocese of M\u00fcnster. In addition to the office for St Liudger (Analecta Hymnica [AH] 26, no. 91), the first bishop of the diocese, one can single out the offices for St. Patroclus (not in AH), the Conversion of St. Paul (AH 28, no. 43), the Sending Forth of the Apostles (AH 5, no. 22), the Translation of the Three Kings (AH 5, no. 23), the Beheading of John the Baptist (AH 26, no. 51), Sts. Chrysanthus and Daria (AH 25, no. 73) and the Holy Lance (partly in AH 5, no. 7). All of these offices are part of a work in progress at the University of Cape Town that will include critical editions of the texts and melodies.<br /><br />The differentiae of each mode have been numbered with a two-digit system: an upper-case letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and a sequentially ordered numeral. The codes for differentiae and chants not found in CAO will be retained for the manuscript sources from the diocese of M\u00fcnster that are currently being indexed.<br /><br />Two breviary manuscript sources, containing the cathedral liturgy of M\u00fcnster, were consulted in order to clarify Feast Name, Office and Position entries in the index for which the printed Antiphoner provides unclear or insufficient information: <i>M\u00fcnster, Nordrhein-Westf\u00e4lisches Staatsarchiv, Verein f\u00fcr Geschichte und Altertumskunde Westfalens, Abt. M\u00fcnster, Msc. 97 and Msc. 273</i> (D-M\u00dcsa MSS AV97 and AV273). The Fraterherren of M\u00fcnster wrote both of these volumes: the former (1464), containing the winter and spring parts, was written for Hermann von Langen, Dean of the M\u00fcnster cathedral, while the latter (ca. 1480), containing the summer and winter parts was written for a canon of the same cathedral.</p>",

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

        "source_description": "At Bellelay Abbey from as early as 1160 until the suppression of the Abbey in 1797, the Bellelay Gradual has unknown origins. Although an important Premonstratensian manuscript of the Jurassian region, it is likely that the manuscript originated from north-eastern France and was a gift to Bellelay Abbey at its founding. To that effect, the Messine notation is not typical of the Jurassian region, and the manuscript includes many erasures and corrections suggesting adaptation to local practice. Furthermore, only one saint in the Sanctorale is particular to the Jurassian region, St. Imer (Imier), and even this seems to be a later addition from the beginning of the 13th century. The manuscript may have been a gift from the mother house of Lac de Joux Abbey, itself a sister abbey to Saint-Martin de Laon in north-eastern France. ",

A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

C53 1500z is a liturgical miscellany or bound compendium manuscript containing a number of significant interventions, including inserted folios from multiple manuscripts. Marginalia and stamps of ownership link the book to Pe\u00f1afiel, Spain, and the monastery of San Pedro Regalado in La Aguilera in the province of Burgos, Spain. An early modern insertion with chants for St. Francis and St. Clare suggests that a Franciscan, and more specifically, Clarissan, community owned the manuscript at some point in its history. The multiple interventions and alterations make assessing the scribal hands challenging. Many chants have been partially or completely scraped and rewritten, creating a series of palimpsests. Parts of the manuscript are heavily trimmed, especially in the lower margin, often resulting in a missing stave at the bottom or top of the leaves. The style of textual and notational scripts also varies greatly from section to section. The cantor's incipits for the items of the Ordinary of the Mass are not included, indicating that this was a book for the choir.\n\n",

Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

        "source_description": "Since Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

        "source_description": "Since Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

Only the portion of the codex with music, known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations), is inventoried in the Cantus Database.\n\nHildegard composed musical works for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia, which survive mainly in two extant sources, the Dendermonde and Wiesbaden codices.\n\nThe Dendermonde codex was completed before Nov. 1, 1176 in the scriptorium of the Rupertsberg cloister and sent to the Cistercian abbey of Villers in Brabant, Belgium as indicated by the owner\u2019s mark on f. 173v, \u201cLiber s[an]c[t]e Ma[rie de] Villari\u201d (The Benedictine Abbey of Villers). The codex was transferred to the abbey of Affligem in the seventeenth century, at which point \u201cMonasterii Haffligemensis\u201d was marked on f. 1. In 1796, the monks were expelled from Affligem due to the French Revolution, and in 1837, the abbey moved to Dendermonde. Since then, the manuscript has been held by the St. Pieters & Paulusabdij abbey. The codex was rebound in the eighteenth century with white paper flyleaves and \u201cM.S. OPERA HILDEGARDI [sic] VIRGINS\u201d was stamped on its spine. There are also pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand corners in a modern hand.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

BKT.006 (the \u2018Tsgrooten Antiphoner\u2019) was commissioned in 1522 by Antonius Tsgrooten, abbot of the Premonstratensian abbey of Tongerlo, located in the province of Antwerp. The manuscript is a summer volume, holding the chants for the divine office from Easter up until the Sunday before Advent. The corresponding winter volume\u2014with chants from Advent to Holy Week\u2014is in the British Library (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15427). Also commissioned in 1522 was a hymnary (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15426). These three manuscripts are all of similar dimensions, compilation structures, and styles. \n\nAll three manuscripts are of interest for the illuminated miniatures and border flourishing, executed in the Ghent-Bruges style, with particularly elaborate border pages for key feasts. The scribe responsible for the manuscripts, Franciscus van Weert, was a prolific copyist for other Premonstratensian manuscripts, including those at the nearby abbeys of Park and Averbode. \n\nB-Gu, Hs. BKT.006\u2014along with its companion volumes\u2014was heavily edited in the seventeenth century to adhere more consistently with Premonstratensian chant reform. These editorial changes accord with other manuscripts from the order, and conform with the new edition of the Antiphonarium Praemonstratense published by Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers (Paris, 1680). These changes manifest in the erasures of older notes and text, and overwriting in a newer hand. Some chants and rubrics are struck through entirely, whereas new additions and notes are inserted interlinearly or in available margin space.\n\nPrior to the abbey\u2019s dissolution during the French Revolution, the manuscript was gifted to the House of Merode. The Flemish Government bought the manuscript in 2008, after which it was brought to its current home at the Universiteit Gent.",

Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

Based on a comparison with other antiphons within Hildegard's manuscripts that include differentia, antiphons with incipits that go below the final are plagal modes, whilst those that stay above the final are authentic modes.

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

Hildegardis (ff. 1\u2013121v); Liber Viarum Dei S. Elisabeth de Schoenau (ff. 121\u2013152v); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (ff. 153\u2013170v); and an untitled dialogue between a priest and the devil (ff. 170\u2013173v). Only the portion of the codex with music, known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations), is inventoried in the Cantus Database.\n\nHildegard composed musical works for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia, which survive mainly in two extant sources, the Dendermonde and Wiesbaden codices.\n\nThe Dendermonde codex was completed before Nov. 1, 1176 in the scriptorium of the Rupertsberg cloister and sent to the Cistercian abbey of Villers in Brabant, Belgium as indicated by the owner\u2019s mark on f. 173v, \u201cLiber s[an]c[t]e Ma[rie de] Villari\u201d (The Benedictine Abbey of Villers). The codex was transferred to the abbey of Affligem in the seventeenth century, at which point \u201cMonasterii Haffligemensis\u201d was marked on f. 1. In 1796, the monks were expelled from Affligem due to the French Revolution, and in 1837, the abbey moved to Dendermonde. Since then, the manuscript has been held by the St. Pieters & Paulusabdij abbey. The codex was rebound in the eighteenth century with white paper flyleaves and \u201cM.S. OPERA HILDEGARDI [sic] VIRGINS\u201d was stamped on its spine. There are also pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand corners in a modern hand.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8).

        "source_description": "At Bellelay Abbey from as early as 1160 until the suppression of the Abbey in 1797, the Bellelay Gradual has unknown origins. Although an important Premonstratensian manuscript of the Jurassian region, it is likely that the manuscript originated from north-eastern France and was a gift to Bellelay Abbey at its founding. To that effect, the Messine notation is not typical of the Jurassian region, and the manuscript includes many erasures and corrections suggesting adaptation to local practice. Furthermore, only one saint in the Sanctorale is particular to the Jurassian region, St. Imer (Imier), and even this seems to be a later addition from the beginning of the 13th century. The manuscript may have been a gift from the mother house of Lac de Joux Abbey, itself a sister abbey to Saint-Martin de Laon in north-eastern France. ",

        "source_description": "The Dendermonde codex contains works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179) and Elisabeth of Sch\u00f6nau (1129-1165), as well as one anonymous work: Liber Vitae Meritorum S. Hildegardis (ff. 1\u2013121v); Liber Viarum Dei S. Elisabeth de Schoenau (ff. 121\u2013152v); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (ff. 153\u2013170v); and an untitled dialogue between a priest and the devil (ff. 170\u2013173v). Only the portion of the codex with music, known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations), is inventoried in the Cantus Database.\n\nHildegard composed musical works for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia, which survive mainly in two extant sources, the Dendermonde and Wiesbaden codices.\n\nThe Dendermonde codex was completed before Nov. 1, 1176 in the scriptorium of the Rupertsberg cloister and sent to the Cistercian abbey of Villers in Brabant, Belgium as indicated by the owner\u2019s mark on f. 173v, \u201cLiber s[an]c[t]e Ma[rie de] Villari\u201d (The Benedictine Abbey of Villers). The codex was transferred to the abbey of Affligem in the seventeenth century, at which point \u201cMonasterii Haffligemensis\u201d was marked on f. 1. In 1796, the monks were expelled from Affligem due to the French Revolution, and in 1837, the abbey moved to Dendermonde. Since then, the manuscript has been held by the St. Pieters & Paulusabdij abbey. The codex was rebound in the eighteenth century with white paper flyleaves and \u201cM.S. OPERA HILDEGARDI [sic] VIRGINS\u201d was stamped on its spine. There are also pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand corners in a modern hand.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

BKT.006 (the \u2018Tsgrooten Antiphoner\u2019) was commissioned in 1522 by Antonius Tsgrooten, abbot of the Premonstratensian abbey of Tongerlo, located in the province of Antwerp. The manuscript is a summer volume, holding the chants for the divine office from Easter up until the Sunday before Advent. The corresponding winter volume\u2014with chants from Advent to Holy Week\u2014is in the British Library (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15427). Also commissioned in 1522 was a hymnary (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15426). These three manuscripts are all of similar dimensions, compilation structures, and styles. \n\nAll three manuscripts are of interest for the illuminated miniatures and border flourishing, executed in the Ghent-Bruges style, with particularly elaborate border pages for key feasts. The scribe responsible for the manuscripts, Franciscus van Weert, was a prolific copyist for other Premonstratensian manuscripts, including those at the nearby abbeys of Park and Averbode. \n\nB-Gu, Hs. BKT.006\u2014along with its companion volumes\u2014was heavily edited in the seventeenth century to adhere more consistently with Premonstratensian chant reform. These editorial changes accord with other manuscripts from the order, and conform with the new edition of the Antiphonarium Praemonstratense published by Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers (Paris, 1680). These changes manifest in the erasures of older notes and text, and overwriting in a newer hand. Some chants and rubrics are struck through entirely, whereas new additions and notes are inserted interlinearly or in available margin space.\n\nPrior to the abbey\u2019s dissolution during the French Revolution, the manuscript was gifted to the House of Merode. The Flemish Government bought the manuscript in 2008, after which it was brought to its current home at the Universiteit Gent.",

The first page(s) are missing; the Gradual starts with the Alleluia <i>Ostende nobis Domine</i> of the 1st Sunday in Advent. In the Gradual, the Temporale and Sanctorale are not separated. Verses for the offertories are given with neumes. The Gradual section is known for the extraordinary usage of <i>litterae significativae</i> within the neume notation.\n</br>\n<u>The second part</u> of the codex (pp. 429-599) contains sequences by Notker from St. Gall (ca. 840-912); throughout this section the text forms the main body of each page with adiastematic neumes in the margins. \n</br>\nThe codex was written in Einsiedeln, likely for the third abbot of the cloister, Gregor the Englishman. Some chants are neumed by later hands. The pages of Einsiedeln 121 are numbered with a modern hand in black ink in the upper outside corners of the leaves (pp. 1-600); there is no original numbering. The manuscript includes various illuminated letters, mostly in the Gradual, and three large illustrations that cover the entire page: an ornamented monogram (p. 204: <i>In die sancto Resurrectionis Domini ad Missam</i>), the ornamented \u201cResurrexi\u201d of Easter Sunday\u2019s Introit (p. 205), and another ornamented monogram (p. 436: <i>In nomine Domini incipit Lyber Ymnorum Notkeri</i>).",

        "source_description": "B-Gu, Hs. BKT.006 (the \u2018Tsgrooten Antiphoner\u2019) was commissioned in 1522 by Antonius Tsgrooten, abbot of the Premonstratensian abbey of Tongerlo, located in the province of Antwerp. The manuscript is a summer volume, holding the chants for the divine office from Easter up until the Sunday before Advent. The corresponding winter volume\u2014with chants from Advent to Holy Week\u2014is in the British Library (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15427). Also commissioned in 1522 was a hymnary (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15426). These three manuscripts are all of similar dimensions, compilation structures, and styles. \n\nAll three manuscripts are of interest for the illuminated miniatures and border flourishing, executed in the Ghent-Bruges style, with particularly elaborate border pages for key feasts. The scribe responsible for the manuscripts, Franciscus van Weert, was a prolific copyist for other Premonstratensian manuscripts, including those at the nearby abbeys of Park and Averbode. \n\nB-Gu, Hs. BKT.006\u2014along with its companion volumes\u2014was heavily edited in the seventeenth century to adhere more consistently with Premonstratensian chant reform. These editorial changes accord with other manuscripts from the order, and conform with the new edition of the Antiphonarium Praemonstratense published by Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers (Paris, 1680). These changes manifest in the erasures of older notes and text, and overwriting in a newer hand. Some chants and rubrics are struck through entirely, whereas new additions and notes are inserted interlinearly or in available margin space.\n\nPrior to the abbey\u2019s dissolution during the French Revolution, the manuscript was gifted to the House of Merode. The Flemish Government bought the manuscript in 2008, after which it was brought to its current home at the Universiteit Gent.",

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

Codices Claustroneoburgensis (CCl.) 1013, 1012 and 1010 are among the oldest surviving sources in the Klosterneuburg library of the sung Office liturgy. CCl. 1013 and 1012 can be paired to create a complete twelfth-century representation of the church year, since 1012 begins at Pentecost and 1013 ends just before. CCl. 589, 1011, 1015, 1017 and 1018 date from over a century later. Of these later manuscripts, three contain the chants of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pars hiemalis</span> (winter) and two the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pars aestiva</span> (summer).<br /><br />Several of the Offices found in these manuscripts but not included in CAO appear in full in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Analecta hymnica</span> (AH), as well as in other CANTUS files. The Office for Immaculate Conception appears in AH vol. 5, pp. 47-50; Ursula appears in AH vol. 28, pp. 256-9; and Benedict in AH vol. 25, pp. 145-9.<br /><br />The differentiae of each mode have been numbered with a two-digit system: an upper-case letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and a sequentially-ordered numeral. These differentia codes are consistent throughout these eight Klosterneuburg indices.</p><p>The eight Klosterneuburg manuscripts are likely from the female side of the double house and reflect the particular liturgical practices of the women of Klosterneuburg, as discussed by Klugseder, Norton, and Carr.</p>",

Of particular note is the inclusion of the office for Adalbert of Prague, Bishop and Martyr (celebrated April 23), also known as the office Ad festa pretiosi. As Jakub Kubieniec writes in his article on the office (see Bibliography), it appears in several manuscripts from Aachen beginning in the twelfth century, as well as in manuscripts from Krak\u00f3w. Kubieniec challenges an earlier theory that the office originated in Krak\u00f3w, as evidenced from an antiphoner from the Krak\u00f3w Cathedral (c. 1320, MS. 52), and argues that the Aachen antiphoner contains an earlier version of the office.</br></br>\nThe text of the manuscript is Roman miniscule and Gothic text in black ink, with early and high Gothic initials in blue and red ink with filigree, and plant and animal motifs (e.g., ff. 59v, 44v, 27r).

        "source_description": "This manuscript is one part of a four-volume antiphoner comprised of HR-HF Cod. C, D, E, and F, written by the same scribe. This manuscript contains part of Temporale, from the second Sunday after Epiphany and the chants for the weekly ferial Office until Holy Saturday. Although the material in this manuscript follows that of Codex C, the four manuscripts are not numbered in liturgical order, as their connection was not recognized at the time of cataloguing.\n\nAlthough now held at a Dominican monastery (in the library of the Friars Minor in Dubrovnik, Croatia), the manuscripts are of Franciscan origin, as described by Ana \u010cizmi\u0107, despite not including material for the feasts of St. Francis, St. Anthony of Padua, and St. Clare. A fourteenth-century antiphoner from a nearby Franciscan monastery in Ston also does not include the feasts for these saints, suggesting that this antiphoner is in concordance with the regional rite of Bosnian Franciscan Friars. An inscription in Codex C confirms that the manuscripts were used by the Franciscan friars in Dubrovnik: \u201cTABULA OFFICIORUM HUIUS ANTIPHONARII SPECTANS AD CHORUM SANCTI FRANCISCI RAGUSII [Dubrovnik].\u201d\n\nA psalter, now also held in the Franjeva\u010dki Samostan in Dubrovnik (Codex B Nr. 1), was written in a similar hand and bears the colophon: \u201cExplicit psalterium secundum ritum romane ecclesie. Fratrum sancta marie gratiarum de venetiis. Ordinis obseruatine eximii doctoris sancti hieronymi, scriptum per me uenc fratrem ludouicum ferra eiusdem ordinis professum. Anno domini MCCCC nonaginta die sabb (\u2026).\u201d This inscription reveals the provenance of the psalter, the scribe (friar Ludovico Ferra), and year of completion (1449). While the antiphoner was not written by the same scribe, as evidenced by slight differences in majuscule letters, it likely also dates from the second half of the fifteenth century, possibly also from an Italian scriptorium.\n\nDifferentiae are identified within each mode by their last note and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g., G1, D2, F1, etc. Minor variations are recognized by an alphabetic suffix, e.g. G1b, A1a, F1a, etc.",

        "source_description": "Since Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

Although an important Premonstratensian manuscript of the Jurassian region, it is likely that the manuscript originated from north-eastern France and was a gift to Bellelay Abbey at its founding. To that effect, the Messine notation is not typical of the Jurassian region, and the manuscript includes many erasures and corrections suggesting adaptation to local practice. Furthermore, only one saint in the Sanctorale is particular to the Jurassian region, St. Imer (Imier), and even this seems to be a later addition from the beginning of the 13th century. The manuscript may have been a gift from the mother house of Lac de Joux Abbey, itself a sister abbey to Saint-Martin de Laon in north-eastern France. ",

        "source_description": "Since Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

BKT.006 (the \u2018Tsgrooten Antiphoner\u2019) was commissioned in 1522 by Antonius Tsgrooten, abbot of the Premonstratensian abbey of Tongerlo, located in the province of Antwerp. The manuscript is a summer volume, holding the chants for the divine office from Easter up until the Sunday before Advent. The corresponding winter volume\u2014with chants from Advent to Holy Week\u2014is in the British Library (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15427). Also commissioned in 1522 was a hymnary (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15426). These three manuscripts are all of similar dimensions, compilation structures, and styles. \n\nAll three manuscripts are of interest for the illuminated miniatures and border flourishing, executed in the Ghent-Bruges style, with particularly elaborate border pages for key feasts. The scribe responsible for the manuscripts, Franciscus van Weert, was a prolific copyist for other Premonstratensian manuscripts, including those at the nearby abbeys of Park and Averbode. \n\nB-Gu, Hs. BKT.006\u2014along with its companion volumes\u2014was heavily edited in the seventeenth century to adhere more consistently with Premonstratensian chant reform. These editorial changes accord with other manuscripts from the order, and conform with the new edition of the Antiphonarium Praemonstratense published by Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers (Paris, 1680). These changes manifest in the erasures of older notes and text, and overwriting in a newer hand. Some chants and rubrics are struck through entirely, whereas new additions and notes are inserted interlinearly or in available margin space.\n\nPrior to the abbey\u2019s dissolution during the French Revolution, the manuscript was gifted to the House of Merode. The Flemish Government bought the manuscript in 2008, after which it was brought to its current home at the Universiteit Gent.",

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

        "source_description": "Since Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

The other five manuscripts are:\n    Krak\u00f3w, Klastor OO. Karmelit\u00f3w na Piasku (Carmelite Convent), Ms.2 (rkp. Perg. 14)\n    Krak\u00f3w, Klastor OO.

Perg. = R\u0119kopis Pergament; The manuscripts still remaining at the Carmelite convent in Krak\u00f3w have been numbered (Ms. 1 - Ms. 5) chronologically, earliest to latest, by James Boyce. The \"r\u0119kopis\" (Polish for 'manuscript') numbers assigned by Jerzy Go\u0142os, who ordered the sources by size from largest to smallest, have been retained in parentheses with the abbreviation \"rkp\".]\nThe Carmelite convent in Prague was founded from Germany in 1347, and then the Krak\u00f3w convent was founded from Prague. The manuscript contents follow the Carmelite usage as defined by the Ordinal of Sibert de Beka of 1312 with some additional feasts such as St. Wenceslaus and St. Ludmila, of particular significance to the tradition of Prague.\nKrak\u00f3w mss. 1-4 and the Wroc\u0142aw manuscript were revised in the middle of the eighteenth century for continuing use in the convent; one would suppose, therefore, that the medieval version of the chant was still in use up to that time. In the course of the revision several offices had palimpsest chants for newer feasts written over them, so that much of the original chant has been lost.\nThis manuscript contains two misbound pages. These leaves have been switched: the leaf with page-numbering \u201c101/102\u201d should follow the page numbered as \u201c118,\u201d and the leaf numbered as \u201c119/120\u201d should follow page 100.\nContributors to MS Description: JB (08/2006), ed.

Hildegardis (ff. 1\u2013121v); Liber Viarum Dei S. Elisabeth de Schoenau (ff. 121\u2013152v); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (ff. 153\u2013170v); and an untitled dialogue between a priest and the devil (ff. 170\u2013173v). Only the portion of the codex with music, known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations), is inventoried in the Cantus Database.\n\nHildegard composed musical works for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia, which survive mainly in two extant sources, the Dendermonde and Wiesbaden codices.\n\nThe Dendermonde codex was completed before Nov. 1, 1176 in the scriptorium of the Rupertsberg cloister and sent to the Cistercian abbey of Villers in Brabant, Belgium as indicated by the owner\u2019s mark on f. 173v, \u201cLiber s[an]c[t]e Ma[rie de] Villari\u201d (The Benedictine Abbey of Villers). The codex was transferred to the abbey of Affligem in the seventeenth century, at which point \u201cMonasterii Haffligemensis\u201d was marked on f. 1. In 1796, the monks were expelled from Affligem due to the French Revolution, and in 1837, the abbey moved to Dendermonde. Since then, the manuscript has been held by the St. Pieters & Paulusabdij abbey. The codex was rebound in the eighteenth century with white paper flyleaves and \u201cM.S. OPERA HILDEGARDI [sic] VIRGINS\u201d was stamped on its spine. There are also pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand corners in a modern hand.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

        "source_description": "NZ-Wt MSR-03 is likely the second of a pair of antiphonals as it contains the <i>pars aestiva,</i> that is, the liturgical material from Easter Day forward, both Temporale and Sanctorale. The volume containing the <i>pars hiemalis</i> is yet to be found. <br/>\nInside the front cover of the binding on the front pastedown is the 15th-century ownership inscription, \u201cLiber co[n]vent[us] s[anc]ti monaliu[m] s[anc]te Agathe v[ir]gi[ni]s Am[er]sfor.e.\u201d Thus, the provenance of this book has been ascribed to the Augustinian abbey of the Sisters of the Common Life at Amersfoort. The association of NZ-Wt MSR-03 with a women\u2019s house is further supported by the inclusion near the end of the manuscript of additional Marian chants and some less-common Offices for female saints. In more recent years, this manuscript was acquired by Albert Clemas (1880?-1956) and later sold by him in 1933 to the British and Foreign Bible Society of New Zealand. In 1978, it was deposited into the Alexander Turnbull Library, now a division of the National Library of New Zealand, on permanent loan from the Bible Society.<br/>\nJust beneath the 15th-century inscription on the front pastedown appears \u201cHymns Versicles and antiphons\u201d in pencil in a modern cursive hand. The first flyleaf contains more of the same hand in pencil and a cutting from an English bookseller\u2019s catalogue that provides a different interpretation of the ownership inscription on the pastedown. The second front flyleaf is blank (recto and verso), and there is a single chant on the recto side of the third front flyleaf (indexed as f. 000r). There are no apparent folio numbers, so the inventory follows the numbering of the digital images posted online by the library. The main body of the manuscript contains 190 paper leaves (ff. 001r-190r). The following are blank: ff. 162v, 169v, 170r, 170v, and 190v.<br/>\nThe binding consists of plain, brown, limp vellum with a fold-over flap and repaired/renewed ties that extend around the entire book. The paper in this manuscript contain numerous watermarks: at least 11 different watermarks and variants are indicated in the library catalogue description, including versions of Briquet 3625 (1480), 6112-6113 (similar types all later 15th century), 8623 (1484), 8655-8682 (all later 15th century), 9182 (1467), 12478 (1481), and 14187-14213 (all later 15th century). The collation of leaves has the following organization: i-vi\u00b9\u2070, vii-xviii\u2078, xix\u2076, xx\u2078, xxi\u2078+\u00b2, xxii\u00b9\u2070, with three different series of faint contemporary leaf signatures from \u201cA\u201d to \u201c[m]\u201d on gatherings 1-13 (ff. 000r-116v), \u201c[a]\u201d to \u201cF\u201d on gathering 14-19 (ff. 117r-162v), and from \u201ca\u201d to \u201c[c]\u201d on gatherings 20-22 (ff. 163r-190v). The gatherings are numbered in pencil in the upper-right-hand corners of the recto sides (\u201c1\u201d on f. 000r, \u201c2\u201d on 011r, \u201c3\u201d on f. 021r, \u201c4\u201d on f. 031r, \u201c5\u201d on f. 041r, \u201c6\u201d on f. 051r, \u201c7\u201d on f. 061r, \u201c8\u201d on f. 069r, \u201c9\u201d on f. 077r, \u201c10\u201d on f. 085r, \u201c11\u201d on f. 093r, \u201c12\u201d on f. 101r, \u201c13\u201d on f. 109r, \u201c14\u201d on f. 117r, \u201c15\u201d on f. 125r, \u201c16\u201d on f. 133r, \u201c17\u201d on f. 141r, \u201c18\u201d on f. 149r, \u201c19\u201d on f. 157r, \u201c20\u201d on f. 163r, \u201c21\u201d on f. 171r, \u201c22\u201d on f. 181r).<br/>\nThe leaves are ruled in faint plummet, with six systems per folio side of 4-line inked staves with F- and C-clefs. The notation is Hufnagelschrift. The black/brown text script is in a Gothic liturgical hand, and the library catalogue identifies three main scribes (changing after ff. 116 and 162, corresponding with changes of runs of signatures). Ff. 091v-092r appear to be in a slightly later hand with a different ink (now flaking off). Throughout the manuscript, rubrics are in red, and some liturgical directions are underlined in red. There are approximately 290 calligraphic initials in black, touched in red, infilled with black penwork (to f. 116 only) of which nearly fifty include human faces or profiles, mostly of monks or of grotesque unshaven figures spitting. Approximately 316 large initials are painted in red or occasionally in blue. Three large initials (c. 50 x 60 mm) are elaborately drawn in blue with penwork infilling and full-length marginal flourishing in red partly infilled with a green wash; these mark the beginning of the Sanctorale (f. 001r), Common of the Saints (f. 092v) and Temporale f. 117r). On f. 001r and 092v the border terminates in a bushy-tailed dragon. Space for a fourth large initial for Pentecost (f. 136r) was left blank.",

        "source_description": "The Dendermonde codex contains works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179) and Elisabeth of Sch\u00f6nau (1129-1165), as well as one anonymous work: Liber Vitae Meritorum S. Hildegardis (ff. 1\u2013121v); Liber Viarum Dei S. Elisabeth de Schoenau (ff. 121\u2013152v); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (ff. 153\u2013170v); and an untitled dialogue between a priest and the devil (ff. 170\u2013173v). Only the portion of the codex with music, known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations), is inventoried in the Cantus Database.\n\nHildegard composed musical works for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia, which survive mainly in two extant sources, the Dendermonde and Wiesbaden codices.\n\nThe Dendermonde codex was completed before Nov. 1, 1176 in the scriptorium of the Rupertsberg cloister and sent to the Cistercian abbey of Villers in Brabant, Belgium as indicated by the owner\u2019s mark on f. 173v, \u201cLiber s[an]c[t]e Ma[rie de] Villari\u201d (The Benedictine Abbey of Villers). The codex was transferred to the abbey of Affligem in the seventeenth century, at which point \u201cMonasterii Haffligemensis\u201d was marked on f. 1. In 1796, the monks were expelled from Affligem due to the French Revolution, and in 1837, the abbey moved to Dendermonde. Since then, the manuscript has been held by the St. Pieters & Paulusabdij abbey. The codex was rebound in the eighteenth century with white paper flyleaves and \u201cM.S. OPERA HILDEGARDI [sic] VIRGINS\u201d was stamped on its spine. There are also pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand corners in a modern hand.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

",
        "source_description": "Since Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

        "source_description": "B-Gu, Hs. BKT.006 (the \u2018Tsgrooten Antiphoner\u2019) was commissioned in 1522 by Antonius Tsgrooten, abbot of the Premonstratensian abbey of Tongerlo, located in the province of Antwerp. The manuscript is a summer volume, holding the chants for the divine office from Easter up until the Sunday before Advent. The corresponding winter volume\u2014with chants from Advent to Holy Week\u2014is in the British Library (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15427). Also commissioned in 1522 was a hymnary (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15426). These three manuscripts are all of similar dimensions, compilation structures, and styles. \n\nAll three manuscripts are of interest for the illuminated miniatures and border flourishing, executed in the Ghent-Bruges style, with particularly elaborate border pages for key feasts. The scribe responsible for the manuscripts, Franciscus van Weert, was a prolific copyist for other Premonstratensian manuscripts, including those at the nearby abbeys of Park and Averbode. \n\nB-Gu, Hs. BKT.006\u2014along with its companion volumes\u2014was heavily edited in the seventeenth century to adhere more consistently with Premonstratensian chant reform. These editorial changes accord with other manuscripts from the order, and conform with the new edition of the Antiphonarium Praemonstratense published by Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers (Paris, 1680). These changes manifest in the erasures of older notes and text, and overwriting in a newer hand. Some chants and rubrics are struck through entirely, whereas new additions and notes are inserted interlinearly or in available margin space.\n\nPrior to the abbey\u2019s dissolution during the French Revolution, the manuscript was gifted to the House of Merode. The Flemish Government bought the manuscript in 2008, after which it was brought to its current home at the Universiteit Gent.",

        "source_description": "Since Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

        "source_description": "It is quite clear that the monastery was under the influence of the Hirsau reform.  See article by Janka Szendrei in bibliography; the comparison with south German sources, such as the Zwiefalten antiphoner (Karlsruhe, Badische Landesbibliothek - Musikabteilung, Aug. LX), seems to confirm it.\n*It is problematic that this antiphoner contains almost no rubrics.*  For example, the distribution of antiphons for the weekdays is not clear.  It is evident, however, from the size of the initials that the chants are organized, and are not merely unstructured lists of items.  The initials suggest a distribution of items for individual days of the week even when there are no explicit rubrics.  Since the Office of the St. George monastery is well documented \u2013 it is one of the most numerous manuscript collections in Czech libraries \u2013 concordances have been located in two breviaries from the same \u00e9poque: (See online images of these breviaries in the Manuscriptorium digital library: http://www.manuscriptorium.com/apps/main/en/index.php)\n1.

Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

        "source_description": "NZ-Wt MSR-03 is likely the second of a pair of antiphonals as it contains the <i>pars aestiva,</i> that is, the liturgical material from Easter Day forward, both Temporale and Sanctorale. The volume containing the <i>pars hiemalis</i> is yet to be found. <br/>\nInside the front cover of the binding on the front pastedown is the 15th-century ownership inscription, \u201cLiber co[n]vent[us] s[anc]ti monaliu[m] s[anc]te Agathe v[ir]gi[ni]s Am[er]sfor.e.\u201d Thus, the provenance of this book has been ascribed to the Augustinian abbey of the Sisters of the Common Life at Amersfoort. The association of NZ-Wt MSR-03 with a women\u2019s house is further supported by the inclusion near the end of the manuscript of additional Marian chants and some less-common Offices for female saints. In more recent years, this manuscript was acquired by Albert Clemas (1880?-1956) and later sold by him in 1933 to the British and Foreign Bible Society of New Zealand. In 1978, it was deposited into the Alexander Turnbull Library, now a division of the National Library of New Zealand, on permanent loan from the Bible Society.<br/>\nJust beneath the 15th-century inscription on the front pastedown appears \u201cHymns Versicles and antiphons\u201d in pencil in a modern cursive hand. The first flyleaf contains more of the same hand in pencil and a cutting from an English bookseller\u2019s catalogue that provides a different interpretation of the ownership inscription on the pastedown. The second front flyleaf is blank (recto and verso), and there is a single chant on the recto side of the third front flyleaf (indexed as f. 000r). There are no apparent folio numbers, so the inventory follows the numbering of the digital images posted online by the library. The main body of the manuscript contains 190 paper leaves (ff. 001r-190r). The following are blank: ff. 162v, 169v, 170r, 170v, and 190v.<br/>\nThe binding consists of plain, brown, limp vellum with a fold-over flap and repaired/renewed ties that extend around the entire book. The paper in this manuscript contain numerous watermarks: at least 11 different watermarks and variants are indicated in the library catalogue description, including versions of Briquet 3625 (1480), 6112-6113 (similar types all later 15th century), 8623 (1484), 8655-8682 (all later 15th century), 9182 (1467), 12478 (1481), and 14187-14213 (all later 15th century). The collation of leaves has the following organization: i-vi\u00b9\u2070, vii-xviii\u2078, xix\u2076, xx\u2078, xxi\u2078+\u00b2, xxii\u00b9\u2070, with three different series of faint contemporary leaf signatures from \u201cA\u201d to \u201c[m]\u201d on gatherings 1-13 (ff. 000r-116v), \u201c[a]\u201d to \u201cF\u201d on gathering 14-19 (ff. 117r-162v), and from \u201ca\u201d to \u201c[c]\u201d on gatherings 20-22 (ff. 163r-190v). The gatherings are numbered in pencil in the upper-right-hand corners of the recto sides (\u201c1\u201d on f. 000r, \u201c2\u201d on 011r, \u201c3\u201d on f. 021r, \u201c4\u201d on f. 031r, \u201c5\u201d on f. 041r, \u201c6\u201d on f. 051r, \u201c7\u201d on f. 061r, \u201c8\u201d on f. 069r, \u201c9\u201d on f. 077r, \u201c10\u201d on f. 085r, \u201c11\u201d on f. 093r, \u201c12\u201d on f. 101r, \u201c13\u201d on f. 109r, \u201c14\u201d on f. 117r, \u201c15\u201d on f. 125r, \u201c16\u201d on f. 133r, \u201c17\u201d on f. 141r, \u201c18\u201d on f. 149r, \u201c19\u201d on f. 157r, \u201c20\u201d on f. 163r, \u201c21\u201d on f. 171r, \u201c22\u201d on f. 181r).<br/>\nThe leaves are ruled in faint plummet, with six systems per folio side of 4-line inked staves with F- and C-clefs. The notation is Hufnagelschrift. The black/brown text script is in a Gothic liturgical hand, and the library catalogue identifies three main scribes (changing after ff. 116 and 162, corresponding with changes of runs of signatures). Ff. 091v-092r appear to be in a slightly later hand with a different ink (now flaking off). Throughout the manuscript, rubrics are in red, and some liturgical directions are underlined in red. There are approximately 290 calligraphic initials in black, touched in red, infilled with black penwork (to f. 116 only) of which nearly fifty include human faces or profiles, mostly of monks or of grotesque unshaven figures spitting. Approximately 316 large initials are painted in red or occasionally in blue. Three large initials (c. 50 x 60 mm) are elaborately drawn in blue with penwork infilling and full-length marginal flourishing in red partly infilled with a green wash; these mark the beginning of the Sanctorale (f. 001r), Common of the Saints (f. 092v) and Temporale f. 117r). On f. 001r and 092v the border terminates in a bushy-tailed dragon. Space for a fourth large initial for Pentecost (f. 136r) was left blank.",

        "source_description": "At Bellelay Abbey from as early as 1160 until the suppression of the Abbey in 1797, the Bellelay Gradual has unknown origins. Although an important Premonstratensian manuscript of the Jurassian region, it is likely that the manuscript originated from north-eastern France and was a gift to Bellelay Abbey at its founding. To that effect, the Messine notation is not typical of the Jurassian region, and the manuscript includes many erasures and corrections suggesting adaptation to local practice. Furthermore, only one saint in the Sanctorale is particular to the Jurassian region, St. Imer (Imier), and even this seems to be a later addition from the beginning of the 13th century. The manuscript may have been a gift from the mother house of Lac de Joux Abbey, itself a sister abbey to Saint-Martin de Laon in north-eastern France. ",

        "source_description": "It is quite clear that the monastery was under the influence of the Hirsau reform.  See article by Janka Szendrei in bibliography; the comparison with south German sources, such as the Zwiefalten antiphoner (Karlsruhe, Badische Landesbibliothek - Musikabteilung, Aug. LX), seems to confirm it.\n*It is problematic that this antiphoner contains almost no rubrics.*  For example, the distribution of antiphons for the weekdays is not clear.  It is evident, however, from the size of the initials that the chants are organized, and are not merely unstructured lists of items.  The initials suggest a distribution of items for individual days of the week even when there are no explicit rubrics.  Since the Office of the St. George monastery is well documented \u2013 it is one of the most numerous manuscript collections in Czech libraries \u2013 concordances have been located in two breviaries from the same \u00e9poque: (See online images of these breviaries in the Manuscriptorium digital library: http://www.manuscriptorium.com/apps/main/en/index.php)\n1.

        "source_description": "The Dendermonde codex contains works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179) and Elisabeth of Sch\u00f6nau (1129-1165), as well as one anonymous work: Liber Vitae Meritorum S. Hildegardis (ff. 1\u2013121v); Liber Viarum Dei S. Elisabeth de Schoenau (ff. 121\u2013152v); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (ff. 153\u2013170v); and an untitled dialogue between a priest and the devil (ff. 170\u2013173v). Only the portion of the codex with music, known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations), is inventoried in the Cantus Database.\n\nHildegard composed musical works for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia, which survive mainly in two extant sources, the Dendermonde and Wiesbaden codices.\n\nThe Dendermonde codex was completed before Nov. 1, 1176 in the scriptorium of the Rupertsberg cloister and sent to the Cistercian abbey of Villers in Brabant, Belgium as indicated by the owner\u2019s mark on f. 173v, \u201cLiber s[an]c[t]e Ma[rie de] Villari\u201d (The Benedictine Abbey of Villers). The codex was transferred to the abbey of Affligem in the seventeenth century, at which point \u201cMonasterii Haffligemensis\u201d was marked on f. 1. In 1796, the monks were expelled from Affligem due to the French Revolution, and in 1837, the abbey moved to Dendermonde. Since then, the manuscript has been held by the St. Pieters & Paulusabdij abbey. The codex was rebound in the eighteenth century with white paper flyleaves and \u201cM.S. OPERA HILDEGARDI [sic] VIRGINS\u201d was stamped on its spine. There are also pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand corners in a modern hand.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

        "source_description": "At Bellelay Abbey from as early as 1160 until the suppression of the Abbey in 1797, the Bellelay Gradual has unknown origins. Although an important Premonstratensian manuscript of the Jurassian region, it is likely that the manuscript originated from north-eastern France and was a gift to Bellelay Abbey at its founding. To that effect, the Messine notation is not typical of the Jurassian region, and the manuscript includes many erasures and corrections suggesting adaptation to local practice. Furthermore, only one saint in the Sanctorale is particular to the Jurassian region, St. Imer (Imier), and even this seems to be a later addition from the beginning of the 13th century. The manuscript may have been a gift from the mother house of Lac de Joux Abbey, itself a sister abbey to Saint-Martin de Laon in north-eastern France. ",

        "source_description": "Spanish-language inscriptions and annotations suggest this antiphoner\u2019s origin and use in Spain, although no date or place of origin or use is recorded or known. Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

        "source_description": "Since Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

BKT.006 (the \u2018Tsgrooten Antiphoner\u2019) was commissioned in 1522 by Antonius Tsgrooten, abbot of the Premonstratensian abbey of Tongerlo, located in the province of Antwerp. The manuscript is a summer volume, holding the chants for the divine office from Easter up until the Sunday before Advent. The corresponding winter volume\u2014with chants from Advent to Holy Week\u2014is in the British Library (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15427). Also commissioned in 1522 was a hymnary (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15426). These three manuscripts are all of similar dimensions, compilation structures, and styles. \n\nAll three manuscripts are of interest for the illuminated miniatures and border flourishing, executed in the Ghent-Bruges style, with particularly elaborate border pages for key feasts. The scribe responsible for the manuscripts, Franciscus van Weert, was a prolific copyist for other Premonstratensian manuscripts, including those at the nearby abbeys of Park and Averbode. \n\nB-Gu, Hs. BKT.006\u2014along with its companion volumes\u2014was heavily edited in the seventeenth century to adhere more consistently with Premonstratensian chant reform. These editorial changes accord with other manuscripts from the order, and conform with the new edition of the Antiphonarium Praemonstratense published by Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers (Paris, 1680). These changes manifest in the erasures of older notes and text, and overwriting in a newer hand. Some chants and rubrics are struck through entirely, whereas new additions and notes are inserted interlinearly or in available margin space.\n\nPrior to the abbey\u2019s dissolution during the French Revolution, the manuscript was gifted to the House of Merode. The Flemish Government bought the manuscript in 2008, after which it was brought to its current home at the Universiteit Gent.",

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

        "source_description": "NZ-Wt MSR-03 is likely the second of a pair of antiphonals as it contains the <i>pars aestiva,</i> that is, the liturgical material from Easter Day forward, both Temporale and Sanctorale. The volume containing the <i>pars hiemalis</i> is yet to be found. <br/>\nInside the front cover of the binding on the front pastedown is the 15th-century ownership inscription, \u201cLiber co[n]vent[us] s[anc]ti monaliu[m] s[anc]te Agathe v[ir]gi[ni]s Am[er]sfor.e.\u201d Thus, the provenance of this book has been ascribed to the Augustinian abbey of the Sisters of the Common Life at Amersfoort. The association of NZ-Wt MSR-03 with a women\u2019s house is further supported by the inclusion near the end of the manuscript of additional Marian chants and some less-common Offices for female saints. In more recent years, this manuscript was acquired by Albert Clemas (1880?-1956) and later sold by him in 1933 to the British and Foreign Bible Society of New Zealand. In 1978, it was deposited into the Alexander Turnbull Library, now a division of the National Library of New Zealand, on permanent loan from the Bible Society.<br/>\nJust beneath the 15th-century inscription on the front pastedown appears \u201cHymns Versicles and antiphons\u201d in pencil in a modern cursive hand. The first flyleaf contains more of the same hand in pencil and a cutting from an English bookseller\u2019s catalogue that provides a different interpretation of the ownership inscription on the pastedown. The second front flyleaf is blank (recto and verso), and there is a single chant on the recto side of the third front flyleaf (indexed as f. 000r). There are no apparent folio numbers, so the inventory follows the numbering of the digital images posted online by the library. The main body of the manuscript contains 190 paper leaves (ff. 001r-190r). The following are blank: ff. 162v, 169v, 170r, 170v, and 190v.<br/>\nThe binding consists of plain, brown, limp vellum with a fold-over flap and repaired/renewed ties that extend around the entire book. The paper in this manuscript contain numerous watermarks: at least 11 different watermarks and variants are indicated in the library catalogue description, including versions of Briquet 3625 (1480), 6112-6113 (similar types all later 15th century), 8623 (1484), 8655-8682 (all later 15th century), 9182 (1467), 12478 (1481), and 14187-14213 (all later 15th century). The collation of leaves has the following organization: i-vi\u00b9\u2070, vii-xviii\u2078, xix\u2076, xx\u2078, xxi\u2078+\u00b2, xxii\u00b9\u2070, with three different series of faint contemporary leaf signatures from \u201cA\u201d to \u201c[m]\u201d on gatherings 1-13 (ff. 000r-116v), \u201c[a]\u201d to \u201cF\u201d on gathering 14-19 (ff. 117r-162v), and from \u201ca\u201d to \u201c[c]\u201d on gatherings 20-22 (ff. 163r-190v). The gatherings are numbered in pencil in the upper-right-hand corners of the recto sides (\u201c1\u201d on f. 000r, \u201c2\u201d on 011r, \u201c3\u201d on f. 021r, \u201c4\u201d on f. 031r, \u201c5\u201d on f. 041r, \u201c6\u201d on f. 051r, \u201c7\u201d on f. 061r, \u201c8\u201d on f. 069r, \u201c9\u201d on f. 077r, \u201c10\u201d on f. 085r, \u201c11\u201d on f. 093r, \u201c12\u201d on f. 101r, \u201c13\u201d on f. 109r, \u201c14\u201d on f. 117r, \u201c15\u201d on f. 125r, \u201c16\u201d on f. 133r, \u201c17\u201d on f. 141r, \u201c18\u201d on f. 149r, \u201c19\u201d on f. 157r, \u201c20\u201d on f. 163r, \u201c21\u201d on f. 171r, \u201c22\u201d on f. 181r).<br/>\nThe leaves are ruled in faint plummet, with six systems per folio side of 4-line inked staves with F- and C-clefs. The notation is Hufnagelschrift. The black/brown text script is in a Gothic liturgical hand, and the library catalogue identifies three main scribes (changing after ff. 116 and 162, corresponding with changes of runs of signatures). Ff. 091v-092r appear to be in a slightly later hand with a different ink (now flaking off). Throughout the manuscript, rubrics are in red, and some liturgical directions are underlined in red. There are approximately 290 calligraphic initials in black, touched in red, infilled with black penwork (to f. 116 only) of which nearly fifty include human faces or profiles, mostly of monks or of grotesque unshaven figures spitting. Approximately 316 large initials are painted in red or occasionally in blue. Three large initials (c. 50 x 60 mm) are elaborately drawn in blue with penwork infilling and full-length marginal flourishing in red partly infilled with a green wash; these mark the beginning of the Sanctorale (f. 001r), Common of the Saints (f. 092v) and Temporale f. 117r). On f. 001r and 092v the border terminates in a bushy-tailed dragon. Space for a fourth large initial for Pentecost (f. 136r) was left blank.",

The other five manuscripts are:\n    Krak\u00f3w, Klastor OO. Karmelit\u00f3w na Piasku (Carmelite Convent), Ms.2 (rkp. Perg. 14)\n    Krak\u00f3w, Klastor OO.

Perg. = R\u0119kopis Pergament; The manuscripts still remaining at the Carmelite convent in Krak\u00f3w have been numbered (Ms. 1 - Ms. 5) chronologically, earliest to latest, by James Boyce. The \"r\u0119kopis\" (Polish for 'manuscript') numbers assigned by Jerzy Go\u0142os, who ordered the sources by size from largest to smallest, have been retained in parentheses with the abbreviation \"rkp\".]\nThe Carmelite convent in Prague was founded from Germany in 1347, and then the Krak\u00f3w convent was founded from Prague. The manuscript contents follow the Carmelite usage as defined by the Ordinal of Sibert de Beka of 1312 with some additional feasts such as St. Wenceslaus and St. Ludmila, of particular significance to the tradition of Prague.\nKrak\u00f3w mss. 1-4 and the Wroc\u0142aw manuscript were revised in the middle of the eighteenth century for continuing use in the convent; one would suppose, therefore, that the medieval version of the chant was still in use up to that time. In the course of the revision several offices had palimpsest chants for newer feasts written over them, so that much of the original chant has been lost.\nThis manuscript contains two misbound pages. These leaves have been switched: the leaf with page-numbering \u201c101/102\u201d should follow the page numbered as \u201c118,\u201d and the leaf numbered as \u201c119/120\u201d should follow page 100.\nContributors to MS Description: JB (08/2006), ed.

Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

Hildegardis (ff. 1\u2013121v); Liber Viarum Dei S. Elisabeth de Schoenau (ff. 121\u2013152v); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (ff. 153\u2013170v); and an untitled dialogue between a priest and the devil (ff. 170\u2013173v). Only the portion of the codex with music, known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations), is inventoried in the Cantus Database.\n\nHildegard composed musical works for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia, which survive mainly in two extant sources, the Dendermonde and Wiesbaden codices.\n\nThe Dendermonde codex was completed before Nov. 1, 1176 in the scriptorium of the Rupertsberg cloister and sent to the Cistercian abbey of Villers in Brabant, Belgium as indicated by the owner\u2019s mark on f. 173v, \u201cLiber s[an]c[t]e Ma[rie de] Villari\u201d (The Benedictine Abbey of Villers). The codex was transferred to the abbey of Affligem in the seventeenth century, at which point \u201cMonasterii Haffligemensis\u201d was marked on f. 1. In 1796, the monks were expelled from Affligem due to the French Revolution, and in 1837, the abbey moved to Dendermonde. Since then, the manuscript has been held by the St. Pieters & Paulusabdij abbey. The codex was rebound in the eighteenth century with white paper flyleaves and \u201cM.S. OPERA HILDEGARDI [sic] VIRGINS\u201d was stamped on its spine.

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

        "source_description": "Since Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

        "source_description": "This manuscript was likely created for use at the male collegiate church of St. Mary in Aachen, as evidenced by the saints' feasts included in the antiphoner. Of particular note is the inclusion of the office for Adalbert of Prague, Bishop and Martyr (celebrated April 23), also known as the office Ad festa pretiosi. As Jakub Kubieniec writes in his article on the office (see Bibliography), it appears in several manuscripts from Aachen beginning in the twelfth century, as well as in manuscripts from Krak\u00f3w. Kubieniec challenges an earlier theory that the office originated in Krak\u00f3w, as evidenced from an antiphoner from the Krak\u00f3w Cathedral (c. 1320, MS. 52), and argues that the Aachen antiphoner contains an earlier version of the office.</br></br>\nThe text of the manuscript is Roman miniscule and Gothic text in black ink, with early and high Gothic initials in blue and red ink with filigree, and plant and animal motifs (e.g., ff. 59v, 44v, 27r). Additions to the manuscript were made in the thirteenth to fifteenth century in various hands (f. 364r-406v).</br></br>\nDifferentiae are indexed by their last note and an arbitrarily assigned number.

Hartmann of Tachau and several other Carmelites, the most interesting of whom is Brother [presumably Fr.] Procopius, the cantor who directed the choir for forty-six years.

        "source_description": "B-Gu, Hs. BKT.006 (the \u2018Tsgrooten Antiphoner\u2019) was commissioned in 1522 by Antonius Tsgrooten, abbot of the Premonstratensian abbey of Tongerlo, located in the province of Antwerp. The manuscript is a summer volume, holding the chants for the divine office from Easter up until the Sunday before Advent. The corresponding winter volume\u2014with chants from Advent to Holy Week\u2014is in the British Library (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15427). Also commissioned in 1522 was a hymnary (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15426). These three manuscripts are all of similar dimensions, compilation structures, and styles. \n\nAll three manuscripts are of interest for the illuminated miniatures and border flourishing, executed in the Ghent-Bruges style, with particularly elaborate border pages for key feasts. The scribe responsible for the manuscripts, Franciscus van Weert, was a prolific copyist for other Premonstratensian manuscripts, including those at the nearby abbeys of Park and Averbode. \n\nB-Gu, Hs. BKT.006\u2014along with its companion volumes\u2014was heavily edited in the seventeenth century to adhere more consistently with Premonstratensian chant reform. These editorial changes accord with other manuscripts from the order, and conform with the new edition of the Antiphonarium Praemonstratense published by Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers (Paris, 1680). These changes manifest in the erasures of older notes and text, and overwriting in a newer hand. Some chants and rubrics are struck through entirely, whereas new additions and notes are inserted interlinearly or in available margin space.\n\nPrior to the abbey\u2019s dissolution during the French Revolution, the manuscript was gifted to the House of Merode. The Flemish Government bought the manuscript in 2008, after which it was brought to its current home at the Universiteit Gent.",

Although an important Premonstratensian manuscript of the Jurassian region, it is likely that the manuscript originated from north-eastern France and was a gift to Bellelay Abbey at its founding. To that effect, the Messine notation is not typical of the Jurassian region, and the manuscript includes many erasures and corrections suggesting adaptation to local practice. Furthermore, only one saint in the Sanctorale is particular to the Jurassian region, St. Imer (Imier), and even this seems to be a later addition from the beginning of the 13th century. The manuscript may have been a gift from the mother house of Lac de Joux Abbey, itself a sister abbey to Saint-Martin de Laon in north-eastern France. ",

        "source_description": "Since Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

        "source_description": "Since Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

        "source_description": "It is quite clear that the monastery was under the influence of the Hirsau reform.  See article by Janka Szendrei in bibliography; the comparison with south German sources, such as the Zwiefalten antiphoner (Karlsruhe, Badische Landesbibliothek - Musikabteilung, Aug. LX), seems to confirm it.\n*It is problematic that this antiphoner contains almost no rubrics.*  For example, the distribution of antiphons for the weekdays is not clear.  It is evident, however, from the size of the initials that the chants are organized, and are not merely unstructured lists of items.  The initials suggest a distribution of items for individual days of the week even when there are no explicit rubrics.  Since the Office of the St. George monastery is well documented \u2013 it is one of the most numerous manuscript collections in Czech libraries \u2013 concordances have been located in two breviaries from the same \u00e9poque: (See online images of these breviaries in the Manuscriptorium digital library: http://www.manuscriptorium.com/apps/main/en/index.php)\n1. The breviary of Kunegunda of Kolovraty, a nun who commanded the manuscript between 1365 and 1385, shortly before she became abbess of the St. George Monastery. Shelfmark: Prague, N\u00e1rodn\u00ed knihovna (National Library), XIII E 14a.\nClick (as of 2012): http://www.manuscriptorium.com/apps/main/index.php?request=show_record_n...\n2.

        "source_description": "This manuscript was likely created for use at the male collegiate church of St. Mary in Aachen, as evidenced by the saints' feasts included in the antiphoner. Of particular note is the inclusion of the office for Adalbert of Prague, Bishop and Martyr (celebrated April 23), also known as the office Ad festa pretiosi. As Jakub Kubieniec writes in his article on the office (see Bibliography), it appears in several manuscripts from Aachen beginning in the twelfth century, as well as in manuscripts from Krak\u00f3w. Kubieniec challenges an earlier theory that the office originated in Krak\u00f3w, as evidenced from an antiphoner from the Krak\u00f3w Cathedral (c. 1320, MS. 52), and argues that the Aachen antiphoner contains an earlier version of the office.</br></br>\nThe text of the manuscript is Roman miniscule and Gothic text in black ink, with early and high Gothic initials in blue and red ink with filigree, and plant and animal motifs (e.g., ff. 59v, 44v, 27r). Additions to the manuscript were made in the thirteenth to fifteenth century in various hands (f. 364r-406v).</br></br>\nDifferentiae are indexed by their last note and an arbitrarily assigned number. Slight variations are indicated by a lowercase suffix (e.g., D2, D2a).",

BKT.006 (the \u2018Tsgrooten Antiphoner\u2019) was commissioned in 1522 by Antonius Tsgrooten, abbot of the Premonstratensian abbey of Tongerlo, located in the province of Antwerp. The manuscript is a summer volume, holding the chants for the divine office from Easter up until the Sunday before Advent. The corresponding winter volume\u2014with chants from Advent to Holy Week\u2014is in the British Library (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15427). Also commissioned in 1522 was a hymnary (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15426). These three manuscripts are all of similar dimensions, compilation structures, and styles. \n\nAll three manuscripts are of interest for the illuminated miniatures and border flourishing, executed in the Ghent-Bruges style, with particularly elaborate border pages for key feasts. The scribe responsible for the manuscripts, Franciscus van Weert, was a prolific copyist for other Premonstratensian manuscripts, including those at the nearby abbeys of Park and Averbode. \n\nB-Gu, Hs. BKT.006\u2014along with its companion volumes\u2014was heavily edited in the seventeenth century to adhere more consistently with Premonstratensian chant reform. These editorial changes accord with other manuscripts from the order, and conform with the new edition of the Antiphonarium Praemonstratense published by Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers (Paris, 1680). These changes manifest in the erasures of older notes and text, and overwriting in a newer hand. Some chants and rubrics are struck through entirely, whereas new additions and notes are inserted interlinearly or in available margin space.\n\nPrior to the abbey\u2019s dissolution during the French Revolution, the manuscript was gifted to the House of Merode. The Flemish Government bought the manuscript in 2008, after which it was brought to its current home at the Universiteit Gent.",

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a).

Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

        "source_description": "At Bellelay Abbey from as early as 1160 until the suppression of the Abbey in 1797, the Bellelay Gradual has unknown origins. Although an important Premonstratensian manuscript of the Jurassian region, it is likely that the manuscript originated from north-eastern France and was a gift to Bellelay Abbey at its founding. To that effect, the Messine notation is not typical of the Jurassian region, and the manuscript includes many erasures and corrections suggesting adaptation to local practice. Furthermore, only one saint in the Sanctorale is particular to the Jurassian region, St. Imer (Imier), and even this seems to be a later addition from the beginning of the 13th century. The manuscript may have been a gift from the mother house of Lac de Joux Abbey, itself a sister abbey to Saint-Martin de Laon in north-eastern France. ",

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

        "source_description": "Spanish-language inscriptions and annotations suggest this antiphoner\u2019s origin and use in Spain, although no date or place of origin or use is recorded or known. Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

        "source_description": "Since Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch.

        "source_description": "Spanish-language inscriptions and annotations suggest this antiphoner\u2019s origin and use in Spain, although no date or place of origin or use is recorded or known. Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation.

Although an important Premonstratensian manuscript of the Jurassian region, it is likely that the manuscript originated from north-eastern France and was a gift to Bellelay Abbey at its founding. To that effect, the Messine notation is not typical of the Jurassian region, and the manuscript includes many erasures and corrections suggesting adaptation to local practice. Furthermore, only one saint in the Sanctorale is particular to the Jurassian region, St. Imer (Imier), and even this seems to be a later addition from the beginning of the 13th century. The manuscript may have been a gift from the mother house of Lac de Joux Abbey, itself a sister abbey to Saint-Martin de Laon in north-eastern France. ",

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

Hildegardis (ff. 1\u2013121v); Liber Viarum Dei S. Elisabeth de Schoenau (ff. 121\u2013152v); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (ff. 153\u2013170v); and an untitled dialogue between a priest and the devil (ff. 170\u2013173v). Only the portion of the codex with music, known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations), is inventoried in the Cantus Database.\n\nHildegard composed musical works for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia, which survive mainly in two extant sources, the Dendermonde and Wiesbaden codices.\n\nThe Dendermonde codex was completed before Nov. 1, 1176 in the scriptorium of the Rupertsberg cloister and sent to the Cistercian abbey of Villers in Brabant, Belgium as indicated by the owner\u2019s mark on f. 173v, \u201cLiber s[an]c[t]e Ma[rie de] Villari\u201d (The Benedictine Abbey of Villers). The codex was transferred to the abbey of Affligem in the seventeenth century, at which point \u201cMonasterii Haffligemensis\u201d was marked on f. 1. In 1796, the monks were expelled from Affligem due to the French Revolution, and in 1837, the abbey moved to Dendermonde. Since then, the manuscript has been held by the St. Pieters & Paulusabdij abbey. The codex was rebound in the eighteenth century with white paper flyleaves and \u201cM.S. OPERA HILDEGARDI [sic] VIRGINS\u201d was stamped on its spine.

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

BKT.006 (the \u2018Tsgrooten Antiphoner\u2019) was commissioned in 1522 by Antonius Tsgrooten, abbot of the Premonstratensian abbey of Tongerlo, located in the province of Antwerp. The manuscript is a summer volume, holding the chants for the divine office from Easter up until the Sunday before Advent. The corresponding winter volume\u2014with chants from Advent to Holy Week\u2014is in the British Library (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15427). Also commissioned in 1522 was a hymnary (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15426). These three manuscripts are all of similar dimensions, compilation structures, and styles. \n\nAll three manuscripts are of interest for the illuminated miniatures and border flourishing, executed in the Ghent-Bruges style, with particularly elaborate border pages for key feasts. The scribe responsible for the manuscripts, Franciscus van Weert, was a prolific copyist for other Premonstratensian manuscripts, including those at the nearby abbeys of Park and Averbode. \n\nB-Gu, Hs. BKT.006\u2014along with its companion volumes\u2014was heavily edited in the seventeenth century to adhere more consistently with Premonstratensian chant reform. These editorial changes accord with other manuscripts from the order, and conform with the new edition of the Antiphonarium Praemonstratense published by Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers (Paris, 1680). These changes manifest in the erasures of older notes and text, and overwriting in a newer hand. Some chants and rubrics are struck through entirely, whereas new additions and notes are inserted interlinearly or in available margin space.\n\nPrior to the abbey\u2019s dissolution during the French Revolution, the manuscript was gifted to the House of Merode. The Flemish Government bought the manuscript in 2008, after which it was brought to its current home at the Universiteit Gent.",

The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

Codices Claustroneoburgensis (CCl.) 1013, 1012 and 1010 are among the oldest surviving sources in the Klosterneuburg library of the sung Office liturgy. CCl. 1013 and 1012 can be paired to create a complete twelfth-century representation of the church year, since 1012 begins at Pentecost and 1013 ends just before. CCl. 589, 1011, 1015, 1017 and 1018 date from over a century later. Of these later manuscripts, three contain the chants of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pars hiemalis</span> (winter) and two the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pars aestiva</span> (summer).<br /><br />Several of the Offices found in these manuscripts but not included in CAO appear in full in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Analecta hymnica</span> (AH), as well as in other CANTUS files. The Office for Immaculate Conception appears in AH vol. 5, pp. 47-50; Ursula appears in AH vol. 28, pp. 256-9; and Benedict in AH vol. 25, pp. 145-9.<br /><br />The differentiae of each mode have been numbered with a two-digit system: an upper-case letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and a sequentially-ordered numeral. These differentia codes are consistent throughout these eight Klosterneuburg indices.</p><p>The eight Klosterneuburg manuscripts are likely from the female side of the double house and reflect the particular liturgical practices of the women of Klosterneuburg, as discussed by Klugseder, Norton, and Carr.</p>",

Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

        "source_description": "Spanish-language inscriptions and annotations suggest this antiphoner\u2019s origin and use in Spain, although no date or place of origin or use is recorded or known. Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

        "source_description": "Since Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

        "source_description": "Spanish-language inscriptions and annotations suggest this antiphoner\u2019s origin and use in Spain, although no date or place of origin or use is recorded or known. Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

        "source_description": "NZ-Wt MSR-03 is likely the second of a pair of antiphonals as it contains the <i>pars aestiva,</i> that is, the liturgical material from Easter Day forward, both Temporale and Sanctorale. The volume containing the <i>pars hiemalis</i> is yet to be found. <br/>\nInside the front cover of the binding on the front pastedown is the 15th-century ownership inscription, \u201cLiber co[n]vent[us] s[anc]ti monaliu[m] s[anc]te Agathe v[ir]gi[ni]s Am[er]sfor.e.\u201d Thus, the provenance of this book has been ascribed to the Augustinian abbey of the Sisters of the Common Life at Amersfoort. The association of NZ-Wt MSR-03 with a women\u2019s house is further supported by the inclusion near the end of the manuscript of additional Marian chants and some less-common Offices for female saints. In more recent years, this manuscript was acquired by Albert Clemas (1880?-1956) and later sold by him in 1933 to the British and Foreign Bible Society of New Zealand. In 1978, it was deposited into the Alexander Turnbull Library, now a division of the National Library of New Zealand, on permanent loan from the Bible Society.<br/>\nJust beneath the 15th-century inscription on the front pastedown appears \u201cHymns Versicles and antiphons\u201d in pencil in a modern cursive hand. The first flyleaf contains more of the same hand in pencil and a cutting from an English bookseller\u2019s catalogue that provides a different interpretation of the ownership inscription on the pastedown. The second front flyleaf is blank (recto and verso), and there is a single chant on the recto side of the third front flyleaf (indexed as f. 000r). There are no apparent folio numbers, so the inventory follows the numbering of the digital images posted online by the library. The main body of the manuscript contains 190 paper leaves (ff. 001r-190r). The following are blank: ff. 162v, 169v, 170r, 170v, and 190v.<br/>\nThe binding consists of plain, brown, limp vellum with a fold-over flap and repaired/renewed ties that extend around the entire book. The paper in this manuscript contain numerous watermarks: at least 11 different watermarks and variants are indicated in the library catalogue description, including versions of Briquet 3625 (1480), 6112-6113 (similar types all later 15th century), 8623 (1484), 8655-8682 (all later 15th century), 9182 (1467), 12478 (1481), and 14187-14213 (all later 15th century). The collation of leaves has the following organization: i-vi\u00b9\u2070, vii-xviii\u2078, xix\u2076, xx\u2078, xxi\u2078+\u00b2, xxii\u00b9\u2070, with three different series of faint contemporary leaf signatures from \u201cA\u201d to \u201c[m]\u201d on gatherings 1-13 (ff. 000r-116v), \u201c[a]\u201d to \u201cF\u201d on gathering 14-19 (ff. 117r-162v), and from \u201ca\u201d to \u201c[c]\u201d on gatherings 20-22 (ff. 163r-190v). The gatherings are numbered in pencil in the upper-right-hand corners of the recto sides (\u201c1\u201d on f. 000r, \u201c2\u201d on 011r, \u201c3\u201d on f. 021r, \u201c4\u201d on f. 031r, \u201c5\u201d on f. 041r, \u201c6\u201d on f. 051r, \u201c7\u201d on f. 061r, \u201c8\u201d on f. 069r, \u201c9\u201d on f. 077r, \u201c10\u201d on f. 085r, \u201c11\u201d on f. 093r, \u201c12\u201d on f. 101r, \u201c13\u201d on f. 109r, \u201c14\u201d on f. 117r, \u201c15\u201d on f. 125r, \u201c16\u201d on f. 133r, \u201c17\u201d on f. 141r, \u201c18\u201d on f. 149r, \u201c19\u201d on f. 157r, \u201c20\u201d on f. 163r, \u201c21\u201d on f. 171r, \u201c22\u201d on f. 181r).<br/>\nThe leaves are ruled in faint plummet, with six systems per folio side of 4-line inked staves with F- and C-clefs. The notation is Hufnagelschrift. The black/brown text script is in a Gothic liturgical hand, and the library catalogue identifies three main scribes (changing after ff. 116 and 162, corresponding with changes of runs of signatures). Ff. 091v-092r appear to be in a slightly later hand with a different ink (now flaking off). Throughout the manuscript, rubrics are in red, and some liturgical directions are underlined in red. There are approximately 290 calligraphic initials in black, touched in red, infilled with black penwork (to f. 116 only) of which nearly fifty include human faces or profiles, mostly of monks or of grotesque unshaven figures spitting. Approximately 316 large initials are painted in red or occasionally in blue. Three large initials (c. 50 x 60 mm) are elaborately drawn in blue with penwork infilling and full-length marginal flourishing in red partly infilled with a green wash; these mark the beginning of the Sanctorale (f. 001r), Common of the Saints (f. 092v) and Temporale f. 117r). On f. 001r and 092v the border terminates in a bushy-tailed dragon. Space for a fourth large initial for Pentecost (f. 136r) was left blank.",

        "source_description": "Spanish-language inscriptions and annotations suggest this antiphoner\u2019s origin and use in Spain, although no date or place of origin or use is recorded or known. Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

Although an important Premonstratensian manuscript of the Jurassian region, it is likely that the manuscript originated from north-eastern France and was a gift to Bellelay Abbey at its founding. To that effect, the Messine notation is not typical of the Jurassian region, and the manuscript includes many erasures and corrections suggesting adaptation to local practice. Furthermore, only one saint in the Sanctorale is particular to the Jurassian region, St. Imer (Imier), and even this seems to be a later addition from the beginning of the 13th century. The manuscript may have been a gift from the mother house of Lac de Joux Abbey, itself a sister abbey to Saint-Martin de Laon in north-eastern France. ",

See article by Janka Szendrei in bibliography; the comparison with south German sources, such as the Zwiefalten antiphoner (Karlsruhe, Badische Landesbibliothek - Musikabteilung, Aug. LX), seems to confirm it.\n*It is problematic that this antiphoner contains almost no rubrics.*  For example, the distribution of antiphons for the weekdays is not clear.  It is evident, however, from the size of the initials that the chants are organized, and are not merely unstructured lists of items.  The initials suggest a distribution of items for individual days of the week even when there are no explicit rubrics.  Since the Office of the St. George monastery is well documented \u2013 it is one of the most numerous manuscript collections in Czech libraries \u2013 concordances have been located in two breviaries from the same \u00e9poque: (See online images of these breviaries in the Manuscriptorium digital library: http://www.manuscriptorium.com/apps/main/en/index.php)\n1.

Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

See article by Janka Szendrei in bibliography; the comparison with south German sources, such as the Zwiefalten antiphoner (Karlsruhe, Badische Landesbibliothek - Musikabteilung, Aug. LX), seems to confirm it.\n*It is problematic that this antiphoner contains almost no rubrics.*  For example, the distribution of antiphons for the weekdays is not clear.  It is evident, however, from the size of the initials that the chants are organized, and are not merely unstructured lists of items.  The initials suggest a distribution of items for individual days of the week even when there are no explicit rubrics.  Since the Office of the St. George monastery is well documented \u2013 it is one of the most numerous manuscript collections in Czech libraries \u2013 concordances have been located in two breviaries from the same \u00e9poque: (See online images of these breviaries in the Manuscriptorium digital library: http://www.manuscriptorium.com/apps/main/en/index.php)\n1.

The manuscript contents follow the Carmelite usage as defined by the Ordinal of Sibert de Beka of 1312 with some additional feasts such as St. Wenceslaus and St. Ludmila, of particular significance to the tradition of Prague.\nKrak\u00f3w mss. 1-4 and the Wroc\u0142aw manuscript were revised in the middle of the eighteenth century for continuing use in the convent; one would suppose, therefore, that the medieval version of the chant was still in use up to that time. In the course of the revision several offices had palimpsest chants for newer feasts written over them, so that much of the original chant has been lost.\nThis manuscript contains two misbound pages.

BKT.006 (the \u2018Tsgrooten Antiphoner\u2019) was commissioned in 1522 by Antonius Tsgrooten, abbot of the Premonstratensian abbey of Tongerlo, located in the province of Antwerp. The manuscript is a summer volume, holding the chants for the divine office from Easter up until the Sunday before Advent. The corresponding winter volume\u2014with chants from Advent to Holy Week\u2014is in the British Library (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15427). Also commissioned in 1522 was a hymnary (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15426). These three manuscripts are all of similar dimensions, compilation structures, and styles. \n\nAll three manuscripts are of interest for the illuminated miniatures and border flourishing, executed in the Ghent-Bruges style, with particularly elaborate border pages for key feasts. The scribe responsible for the manuscripts, Franciscus van Weert, was a prolific copyist for other Premonstratensian manuscripts, including those at the nearby abbeys of Park and Averbode. \n\nB-Gu, Hs. BKT.006\u2014along with its companion volumes\u2014was heavily edited in the seventeenth century to adhere more consistently with Premonstratensian chant reform. These editorial changes accord with other manuscripts from the order, and conform with the new edition of the Antiphonarium Praemonstratense published by Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers (Paris, 1680). These changes manifest in the erasures of older notes and text, and overwriting in a newer hand. Some chants and rubrics are struck through entirely, whereas new additions and notes are inserted interlinearly or in available margin space.\n\nPrior to the abbey\u2019s dissolution during the French Revolution, the manuscript was gifted to the House of Merode. The Flemish Government bought the manuscript in 2008, after which it was brought to its current home at the Universiteit Gent.",

The parchment was used to bind volumes of the \"Histoire Ecclesiastique pour servir de continuation \u00e0 celle de Monsieur l'Abb\u00e9 Fleury\" (Paris, Pierre-Jean Mariette, 1720-1730). (See https://cantusdatabase.org/source/714555). \n<p>\nThe parchment pieces found in the Ridgefield Project appear to be from a thirteenth-century antiphoner and gradual from an (as yet unidentified) Cistercian monastery, possibly in France or Belgium. This half folio is composed of six binding pieces (\"Group C\") from Volumes 15, 17, and 21 of the Histoire, and is from an antiphoner. The chants are for the feast of Agatha; it is likely this folio was near \"Group B\" (perhaps even as part of a bifolio).<p>\n\nThe fragments from the Ridgefield Project are: <p>\nGroup A (Gradual): https://fragmentarium.ms/overview/F-b3z1 https://cantusdatabase.org/source/1000008 <br>\n<br>\nGroup B (Antiphoner): https://fragmentarium.ms/overview/F-e78r https://cantusdatabase.org/source/1000006 <br>\n<br>\nGroup C (Antiphoner): https://fragmentarium.ms/overview/F-7lvz  https://cantusdatabase.org/source/1000007 <br>\n<br>\nGroup D (Antiphoner): https://fragmentarium.ms/overview/F-7e7c (not yet published on Fragmentarium) https://cantusdatabase.org/source/1000009<br>\n<br>\nGroup E (Antiphoner): https://fragmentarium.ms/overview/F-ly13 (not yet published on Fragmentarium) https://cantusdatabase.org/source/1000010 <br>\n<br>\nGroup F (Antiphoner): (https://fragmentarium.ms/overview/F-yp1h (partially published on Fragmentarium) https://cantusdatabase.org/source/714555 <br>",

Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

Codices Claustroneoburgensis (CCl.) 1013, 1012 and 1010 are among the oldest surviving sources in the Klosterneuburg library of the sung Office liturgy. CCl. 1013 and 1012 can be paired to create a complete twelfth-century representation of the church year, since 1012 begins at Pentecost and 1013 ends just before. CCl. 589, 1011, 1015, 1017 and 1018 date from over a century later. Of these later manuscripts, three contain the chants of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pars hiemalis</span> (winter) and two the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pars aestiva</span> (summer).<br /><br />Several of the Offices found in these manuscripts but not included in CAO appear in full in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Analecta hymnica</span> (AH), as well as in other CANTUS files. The Office for Immaculate Conception appears in AH vol. 5, pp. 47-50; Ursula appears in AH vol. 28, pp. 256-9; and Benedict in AH vol. 25, pp. 145-9.<br /><br />The differentiae of each mode have been numbered with a two-digit system: an upper-case letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and a sequentially-ordered numeral. These differentia codes are consistent throughout these eight Klosterneuburg indices.</p><p>The eight Klosterneuburg manuscripts are likely from the female side of the double house and reflect the particular liturgical practices of the women of Klosterneuburg, as discussed by Klugseder, Norton, and Carr.</p>",

        "source_description": "<p>This choir book has been in the possession of the Music Library at The University of Western Ontario since the late 1960s, when it was purchased from a book-dealer in Paris. Apparently, this manuscript had been part of the collection at the Burgos monastery. Its prior whereabouts are unknown. There are no names, bookplates, stamps or other marks on the inside covers or elsewhere which might reveal any information about the provenance or the travels of this book prior to its present home. The only library identification marks are those of the University of Western Ontario; these are found on the inside front cover, as well as on the recto side of the first extant folio (fol. 27). The contents offer little insight as to where this volume was produced, used, or housed during the last few centuries.<br /><br />Of the original folios which may have numbered near 200, approximately half are extant. Many have been cut away at the spine and removed from the manuscript. The size of the principal writing-space is 43.8 x 27 cm; this is the interior dimension of the frame-ruling and does not include the liturgical-occasion headings which are written across the top of facing sides in red ink. The binding is original.<br /><br />This antiphoner contains the chants sung by the choir in the Offices of the Temporale surrounding Easter. The first extant folio gives a portion of the Offices for Maundy Thursday. It is reasonable to assume that the missing twenty-six folios at the beginning of the manuscript contained the chants for the six Sundays in Lent and the remainder of Holy Week. Chants for Good Friday (including the Lamentations of Jeremiah), Holy Saturday, and Easter Sunday are followed by those for the weekdays after Easter and the ensuing Sundays in the paschal season. Offices for Ascension and Pentecost are followed by chants for Corpus Christi. A lacuna of ten folios before Corpus Christi most likely accounts for the absence of an Office for Trinity Sunday. Magnificat antiphons for the Sundays after Pentecost up to the month of August fill the last extant folios of this manuscript.<br /></p>",

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

Pryes dieu pour elle.&rdquo; The date of 1554 appears on ff.122r and 197r in Volume I, and on f.16v in Volume II. The date of 1555 appears at the end of Volume I on f.197v and the end of Volume II on f.40v. According to the colophon the book was commissioned by Dame Julienne de Glymes, prioress and former cantrix of the Cistercian Abbey of Salzinnes, Namur, in present day Belgium, likely with parts of it completed in 1554 and the rest in 1555. Founded in 1196-97 by Philip the Noble Count of Namur, the Abbey was incorporated in the Cistercian Order in 1204 under the Diocese of Li\u00e8ge. It was destroyed by the French Revolutionary armies in 1795.<br /><br />The Salzinnes Antiphoner was likely acquired in the 1840s or 1850s in France by Bishop William Walsh, the first Archbishop for the Diocese of Halifax. It was donated to the Patrick Power Library, Saint Mary&rsquo;s University by Archbishop James M. Hayes in 1975.<br /><br />Painted in a bright palette in gouache, the Salzinnes Antiphonal contains six full-page illuminations (Adoration of the Magi, Baptism of Christ, Agony in the Garden, Resurrection, Christ in Majesty, Holy Kinship) and six historiated initials (Annunciation, Adoration of the Shepherds and Saints George, Maurice, Hubert, and Juliana) and includes several scenes depicting multiple narratives from the Bible. The most significant feature of the Antiphonal is the full-length portraits of thirty-four nuns with their names in cursive and block script, some with patrons&rsquo; coats-of-arms. In addition, three different religious orders are represented: Cistercians, Carmelites and Benedictines, in honour of the de Glymes family.</p>\n<p> There are two digitizations of this manuscript, reflecting changes to the manuscript over the course of its history. A rebinding of the book re-ordered the first quire, so that folios are now in the order 2r-7v, 1r-v, 8r. This current ordering is reflected in the high-resolution \"Leuven\" images courtesy of the Alamire Institute.  The \"Montreal\" images are ordered starting from the original 1r, and with several of the inserted and unnumbered full-page illuminations removed for enhanced readability of the chants. \n\"Leuven\" images: cantus.simssa.ca/manuscript/25/\n\"Montreal\" images: cantus.simssa.ca/manuscript/209",

Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

See article by Janka Szendrei in bibliography; the comparison with south German sources, such as the Zwiefalten antiphoner (Karlsruhe, Badische Landesbibliothek - Musikabteilung, Aug. LX), seems to confirm it.\n*It is problematic that this antiphoner contains almost no rubrics.*  For example, the distribution of antiphons for the weekdays is not clear.  It is evident, however, from the size of the initials that the chants are organized, and are not merely unstructured lists of items.  The initials suggest a distribution of items for individual days of the week even when there are no explicit rubrics.  Since the Office of the St. George monastery is well documented \u2013 it is one of the most numerous manuscript collections in Czech libraries \u2013 concordances have been located in two breviaries from the same \u00e9poque: (See online images of these breviaries in the Manuscriptorium digital library: http://www.manuscriptorium.com/apps/main/en/index.php)\n1.

Hildegardis (ff. 1\u2013121v); Liber Viarum Dei S.

        "source_description": "This manuscript is one part of a four-volume antiphoner comprised of HR-HF Cod. C, D, E, and F, written by the same scribe. This manuscript contains the Sanctorale. The manuscripts are not numbered in liturgical order, as their connection was not recognized at the time of cataloguing.\n\nAlthough now held at a Dominican monastery (in the library of the Friars Minor in Dubrovnik, Croatia), the manuscripts are of Franciscan origin, as described by Ana \u010cizmi\u0107, despite not including material for the feasts of St. Francis, St. Anthony of Padua, and St. Clare. A fourteenth-century antiphoner from a nearby Franciscan monastery in Ston also does not include the feasts for these saints, suggesting that this antiphoner is in concordance with the regional rite of Bosnian Franciscan Friars. An inscription in Codex C confirms that the manuscripts were used by the Franciscan friars in Dubrovnik: \u201cTABULA OFFICIORUM HUIUS ANTIPHONARII SPECTANS AD CHORUM SANCTI FRANCISCI RAGUSII [Dubrovnik].\u201d\n\nA psalter, now also held in the Franjeva\u010dki Samostan in Dubrovnik (Codex B Nr. 1), was written in a similar hand and bears the colophon: \u201cExplicit psalterium secundum ritum romane ecclesie. Fratrum sancta marie gratiarum de venetiis. Ordinis obseruatine eximii doctoris sancti hieronymi, scriptum per me uenc fratrem ludouicum ferra eiusdem ordinis professum. Anno domini MCCCC nonaginta die sabb.\u201d This inscription reveals the provenance of the psalter, the scribe (friar Ludovico Ferra), and year of completion (1449). While the antiphoner was not written by the same scribe, as evidenced by slight differences in majuscule letters, it likely also dates from the second half of the fifteenth century, possibly also from an Italian scriptorium.\n\nDifferentiae are identified within each mode by their last note and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g., G1, D2, F1, etc. Minor variations are recognized by an alphabetic suffix, e.g. G1b, A1a, F1a, etc.",

Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

        "source_description": "Since Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

Hildegardis (ff. 1\u2013121v); Liber Viarum Dei S. Elisabeth de Schoenau (ff. 121\u2013152v); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (ff. 153\u2013170v); and an untitled dialogue between a priest and the devil (ff. 170\u2013173v). Only the portion of the codex with music, known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations), is inventoried in the Cantus Database.\n\nHildegard composed musical works for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia, which survive mainly in two extant sources, the Dendermonde and Wiesbaden codices.\n\nThe Dendermonde codex was completed before Nov. 1, 1176 in the scriptorium of the Rupertsberg cloister and sent to the Cistercian abbey of Villers in Brabant, Belgium as indicated by the owner\u2019s mark on f. 173v, \u201cLiber s[an]c[t]e Ma[rie de] Villari\u201d (The Benedictine Abbey of Villers). The codex was transferred to the abbey of Affligem in the seventeenth century, at which point \u201cMonasterii Haffligemensis\u201d was marked on f. 1. In 1796, the monks were expelled from Affligem due to the French Revolution, and in 1837, the abbey moved to Dendermonde. Since then, the manuscript has been held by the St. Pieters & Paulusabdij abbey. The codex was rebound in the eighteenth century with white paper flyleaves and \u201cM.S. OPERA HILDEGARDI [sic] VIRGINS\u201d was stamped on its spine. There are also pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand corners in a modern hand.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8).

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

        "source_description": "Since Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

The date of 1555 appears at the end of Volume I on f.197v and the end of Volume II on f.40v. According to the colophon the book was commissioned by Dame Julienne de Glymes, prioress and former cantrix of the Cistercian Abbey of Salzinnes, Namur, in present day Belgium, likely with parts of it completed in 1554 and the rest in 1555. Founded in 1196-97 by Philip the Noble Count of Namur, the Abbey was incorporated in the Cistercian Order in 1204 under the Diocese of Li\u00e8ge. It was destroyed by the French Revolutionary armies in 1795.<br /><br />The Salzinnes Antiphoner was likely acquired in the 1840s or 1850s in France by Bishop William Walsh, the first Archbishop for the Diocese of Halifax. It was donated to the Patrick Power Library, Saint Mary&rsquo;s University by Archbishop James M. Hayes in 1975.<br /><br />Painted in a bright palette in gouache, the Salzinnes Antiphonal contains six full-page illuminations (Adoration of the Magi, Baptism of Christ, Agony in the Garden, Resurrection, Christ in Majesty, Holy Kinship) and six historiated initials (Annunciation, Adoration of the Shepherds and Saints George, Maurice, Hubert, and Juliana) and includes several scenes depicting multiple narratives from the Bible. The most significant feature of the Antiphonal is the full-length portraits of thirty-four nuns with their names in cursive and block script, some with patrons&rsquo; coats-of-arms. In addition, three different religious orders are represented: Cistercians, Carmelites and Benedictines, in honour of the de Glymes family.</p>\n<p> There are two digitizations of this manuscript, reflecting changes to the manuscript over the course of its history. A rebinding of the book re-ordered the first quire, so that folios are now in the order 2r-7v, 1r-v, 8r. This current ordering is reflected in the high-resolution \"Leuven\" images courtesy of the Alamire Institute.  The \"Montreal\" images are ordered starting from the original 1r, and with several of the inserted and unnumbered full-page illuminations removed for enhanced readability of the chants. \n\"Leuven\" images: cantus.simssa.ca/manuscript/25/\n\"Montreal\" images: cantus.simssa.ca/manuscript/209",

The other five manuscripts are:\n    Krak\u00f3w, Klastor OO. Karmelit\u00f3w na Piasku (Carmelite Convent), Ms.2 (rkp. Perg. 14)\n    Krak\u00f3w, Klastor OO.

Perg. = R\u0119kopis Pergament; The manuscripts still remaining at the Carmelite convent in Krak\u00f3w have been numbered (Ms. 1 - Ms. 5) chronologically, earliest to latest, by James Boyce. The \"r\u0119kopis\" (Polish for 'manuscript') numbers assigned by Jerzy Go\u0142os, who ordered the sources by size from largest to smallest, have been retained in parentheses with the abbreviation \"rkp\".]\nThe Carmelite convent in Prague was founded from Germany in 1347, and then the Krak\u00f3w convent was founded from Prague. The manuscript contents follow the Carmelite usage as defined by the Ordinal of Sibert de Beka of 1312 with some additional feasts such as St. Wenceslaus and St. Ludmila, of particular significance to the tradition of Prague.\nKrak\u00f3w mss. 1-4 and the Wroc\u0142aw manuscript were revised in the middle of the eighteenth century for continuing use in the convent; one would suppose, therefore, that the medieval version of the chant was still in use up to that time. In the course of the revision several offices had palimpsest chants for newer feasts written over them, so that much of the original chant has been lost.\nThis manuscript contains two misbound pages. These leaves have been switched: the leaf with page-numbering \u201c101/102\u201d should follow the page numbered as \u201c118,\u201d and the leaf numbered as \u201c119/120\u201d should follow page 100.\nContributors to MS Description: JB (08/2006), ed.

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

        "source_description": "US-KClbsc M2147. C53 1500z is a liturgical miscellany or bound compendium manuscript containing a number of significant interventions, including inserted folios from multiple manuscripts. Marginalia and stamps of ownership link the book to Pe\u00f1afiel, Spain, and the monastery of San Pedro Regalado in La Aguilera in the province of Burgos, Spain. An early modern insertion with chants for St. Francis and St. Clare suggests that a Franciscan, and more specifically, Clarissan, community owned the manuscript at some point in its history. The multiple interventions and alterations make assessing the scribal hands challenging. Many chants have been partially or completely scraped and rewritten, creating a series of palimpsests. Parts of the manuscript are heavily trimmed, especially in the lower margin, often resulting in a missing stave at the bottom or top of the leaves. The style of textual and notational scripts also varies greatly from section to section. The cantor's incipits for the items of the Ordinary of the Mass are not included, indicating that this was a book for the choir.\n\n",

Although an important Premonstratensian manuscript of the Jurassian region, it is likely that the manuscript originated from north-eastern France and was a gift to Bellelay Abbey at its founding. To that effect, the Messine notation is not typical of the Jurassian region, and the manuscript includes many erasures and corrections suggesting adaptation to local practice. Furthermore, only one saint in the Sanctorale is particular to the Jurassian region, St. Imer (Imier), and even this seems to be a later addition from the beginning of the 13th century. The manuscript may have been a gift from the mother house of Lac de Joux Abbey, itself a sister abbey to Saint-Martin de Laon in north-eastern France. ",

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

Hildegardis (ff. 1\u2013121v); Liber Viarum Dei S. Elisabeth de Schoenau (ff. 121\u2013152v); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (ff. 153\u2013170v); and an untitled dialogue between a priest and the devil (ff. 170\u2013173v). Only the portion of the codex with music, known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations), is inventoried in the Cantus Database.\n\nHildegard composed musical works for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia, which survive mainly in two extant sources, the Dendermonde and Wiesbaden codices.\n\nThe Dendermonde codex was completed before Nov. 1, 1176 in the scriptorium of the Rupertsberg cloister and sent to the Cistercian abbey of Villers in Brabant, Belgium as indicated by the owner\u2019s mark on f. 173v, \u201cLiber s[an]c[t]e Ma[rie de] Villari\u201d (The Benedictine Abbey of Villers). The codex was transferred to the abbey of Affligem in the seventeenth century, at which point \u201cMonasterii Haffligemensis\u201d was marked on f. 1. In 1796, the monks were expelled from Affligem due to the French Revolution, and in 1837, the abbey moved to Dendermonde. Since then, the manuscript has been held by the St. Pieters & Paulusabdij abbey. The codex was rebound in the eighteenth century with white paper flyleaves and \u201cM.S. OPERA HILDEGARDI [sic] VIRGINS\u201d was stamped on its spine.

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

        "source_description": "This manuscript is one part of a four-volume antiphoner comprised of HR-HF Cod. C, D, E, and F, written by the same scribe. This manuscript contains the Sanctorale. The manuscripts are not numbered in liturgical order, as their connection was not recognized at the time of cataloguing.\n\nAlthough now held at a Dominican monastery (in the library of the Friars Minor in Dubrovnik, Croatia), the manuscripts are of Franciscan origin, as described by Ana \u010cizmi\u0107, despite not including material for the feasts of St. Francis, St. Anthony of Padua, and St. Clare. A fourteenth-century antiphoner from a nearby Franciscan monastery in Ston also does not include the feasts for these saints, suggesting that this antiphoner is in concordance with the regional rite of Bosnian Franciscan Friars. An inscription in Codex C confirms that the manuscripts were used by the Franciscan friars in Dubrovnik: \u201cTABULA OFFICIORUM HUIUS ANTIPHONARII SPECTANS AD CHORUM SANCTI FRANCISCI RAGUSII [Dubrovnik].\u201d\n\nA psalter, now also held in the Franjeva\u010dki Samostan in Dubrovnik (Codex B Nr. 1), was written in a similar hand and bears the colophon: \u201cExplicit psalterium secundum ritum romane ecclesie. Fratrum sancta marie gratiarum de venetiis. Ordinis obseruatine eximii doctoris sancti hieronymi, scriptum per me uenc fratrem ludouicum ferra eiusdem ordinis professum. Anno domini MCCCC nonaginta die sabb.\u201d This inscription reveals the provenance of the psalter, the scribe (friar Ludovico Ferra), and year of completion (1449). While the antiphoner was not written by the same scribe, as evidenced by slight differences in majuscule letters, it likely also dates from the second half of the fifteenth century, possibly also from an Italian scriptorium.\n\nDifferentiae are identified within each mode by their last note and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g., G1, D2, F1, etc. Minor variations are recognized by an alphabetic suffix, e.g. G1b, A1a, F1a, etc.",

Of particular note is the inclusion of the office for Adalbert of Prague, Bishop and Martyr (celebrated April 23), also known as the office Ad festa pretiosi. As Jakub Kubieniec writes in his article on the office (see Bibliography), it appears in several manuscripts from Aachen beginning in the twelfth century, as well as in manuscripts from Krak\u00f3w. Kubieniec challenges an earlier theory that the office originated in Krak\u00f3w, as evidenced from an antiphoner from the Krak\u00f3w Cathedral (c. 1320, MS. 52), and argues that the Aachen antiphoner contains an earlier version of the office.</br></br>\nThe text of the manuscript is Roman miniscule and Gothic text in black ink, with early and high Gothic initials in blue and red ink with filigree, and plant and animal motifs (e.g., ff. 59v, 44v, 27r). Additions to the manuscript were made in the thirteenth to fifteenth century in various hands (f. 364r-406v).</br></br>\nDifferentiae are indexed by their last note and an arbitrarily assigned number.

        "source_description": "B-Gu, Hs. BKT.006 (the \u2018Tsgrooten Antiphoner\u2019) was commissioned in 1522 by Antonius Tsgrooten, abbot of the Premonstratensian abbey of Tongerlo, located in the province of Antwerp. The manuscript is a summer volume, holding the chants for the divine office from Easter up until the Sunday before Advent. The corresponding winter volume\u2014with chants from Advent to Holy Week\u2014is in the British Library (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15427). Also commissioned in 1522 was a hymnary (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15426). These three manuscripts are all of similar dimensions, compilation structures, and styles. \n\nAll three manuscripts are of interest for the illuminated miniatures and border flourishing, executed in the Ghent-Bruges style, with particularly elaborate border pages for key feasts. The scribe responsible for the manuscripts, Franciscus van Weert, was a prolific copyist for other Premonstratensian manuscripts, including those at the nearby abbeys of Park and Averbode. \n\nB-Gu, Hs. BKT.006\u2014along with its companion volumes\u2014was heavily edited in the seventeenth century to adhere more consistently with Premonstratensian chant reform. These editorial changes accord with other manuscripts from the order, and conform with the new edition of the Antiphonarium Praemonstratense published by Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers (Paris, 1680). These changes manifest in the erasures of older notes and text, and overwriting in a newer hand. Some chants and rubrics are struck through entirely, whereas new additions and notes are inserted interlinearly or in available margin space.\n\nPrior to the abbey\u2019s dissolution during the French Revolution, the manuscript was gifted to the House of Merode. The Flemish Government bought the manuscript in 2008, after which it was brought to its current home at the Universiteit Gent.",

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

Of particular note is the inclusion of the office for Adalbert of Prague, Bishop and Martyr (celebrated April 23), also known as the office Ad festa pretiosi. As Jakub Kubieniec writes in his article on the office (see Bibliography), it appears in several manuscripts from Aachen beginning in the twelfth century, as well as in manuscripts from Krak\u00f3w. Kubieniec challenges an earlier theory that the office originated in Krak\u00f3w, as evidenced from an antiphoner from the Krak\u00f3w Cathedral (c. 1320, MS. 52), and argues that the Aachen antiphoner contains an earlier version of the office.</br></br>\nThe text of the manuscript is Roman miniscule and Gothic text in black ink, with early and high Gothic initials in blue and red ink with filigree, and plant and animal motifs (e.g., ff. 59v, 44v, 27r). Additions to the manuscript were made in the thirteenth to fifteenth century in various hands (f. 364r-406v).</br></br>\nDifferentiae are indexed by their last note and an arbitrarily assigned number.

Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

Although an important Premonstratensian manuscript of the Jurassian region, it is likely that the manuscript originated from north-eastern France and was a gift to Bellelay Abbey at its founding. To that effect, the Messine notation is not typical of the Jurassian region, and the manuscript includes many erasures and corrections suggesting adaptation to local practice. Furthermore, only one saint in the Sanctorale is particular to the Jurassian region, St. Imer (Imier), and even this seems to be a later addition from the beginning of the 13th century. The manuscript may have been a gift from the mother house of Lac de Joux Abbey, itself a sister abbey to Saint-Martin de Laon in north-eastern France. ",

Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

        "source_description": "The Dendermonde codex contains works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179) and Elisabeth of Sch\u00f6nau (1129-1165), as well as one anonymous work: Liber Vitae Meritorum S. Hildegardis (ff. 1\u2013121v); Liber Viarum Dei S. Elisabeth de Schoenau (ff. 121\u2013152v); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (ff. 153\u2013170v); and an untitled dialogue between a priest and the devil (ff. 170\u2013173v). Only the portion of the codex with music, known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations), is inventoried in the Cantus Database.\n\nHildegard composed musical works for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia, which survive mainly in two extant sources, the Dendermonde and Wiesbaden codices.\n\nThe Dendermonde codex was completed before Nov. 1, 1176 in the scriptorium of the Rupertsberg cloister and sent to the Cistercian abbey of Villers in Brabant, Belgium as indicated by the owner\u2019s mark on f. 173v, \u201cLiber s[an]c[t]e Ma[rie de] Villari\u201d (The Benedictine Abbey of Villers). The codex was transferred to the abbey of Affligem in the seventeenth century, at which point \u201cMonasterii Haffligemensis\u201d was marked on f. 1. In 1796, the monks were expelled from Affligem due to the French Revolution, and in 1837, the abbey moved to Dendermonde. Since then, the manuscript has been held by the St. Pieters & Paulusabdij abbey. The codex was rebound in the eighteenth century with white paper flyleaves and \u201cM.S. OPERA HILDEGARDI [sic] VIRGINS\u201d was stamped on its spine. There are also pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand corners in a modern hand.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

        "source_description": "This manuscript was likely created for use at the male collegiate church of St. Mary in Aachen, as evidenced by the saints' feasts included in the antiphoner. Of particular note is the inclusion of the office for Adalbert of Prague, Bishop and Martyr (celebrated April 23), also known as the office Ad festa pretiosi. As Jakub Kubieniec writes in his article on the office (see Bibliography), it appears in several manuscripts from Aachen beginning in the twelfth century, as well as in manuscripts from Krak\u00f3w. Kubieniec challenges an earlier theory that the office originated in Krak\u00f3w, as evidenced from an antiphoner from the Krak\u00f3w Cathedral (c. 1320, MS. 52), and argues that the Aachen antiphoner contains an earlier version of the office.</br></br>\nThe text of the manuscript is Roman miniscule and Gothic text in black ink, with early and high Gothic initials in blue and red ink with filigree, and plant and animal motifs (e.g., ff. 59v, 44v, 27r). Additions to the manuscript were made in the thirteenth to fifteenth century in various hands (f. 364r-406v).</br></br>\nDifferentiae are indexed by their last note and an arbitrarily assigned number. Slight variations are indicated by a lowercase suffix (e.g., D2, D2a).",

        "source_description": "It is quite clear that the monastery was under the influence of the Hirsau reform.  See article by Janka Szendrei in bibliography; the comparison with south German sources, such as the Zwiefalten antiphoner (Karlsruhe, Badische Landesbibliothek - Musikabteilung, Aug. LX), seems to confirm it.\n*It is problematic that this antiphoner contains almost no rubrics.*  For example, the distribution of antiphons for the weekdays is not clear.  It is evident, however, from the size of the initials that the chants are organized, and are not merely unstructured lists of items.  The initials suggest a distribution of items for individual days of the week even when there are no explicit rubrics.  Since the Office of the St. George monastery is well documented \u2013 it is one of the most numerous manuscript collections in Czech libraries \u2013 concordances have been located in two breviaries from the same \u00e9poque: (See online images of these breviaries in the Manuscriptorium digital library: http://www.manuscriptorium.com/apps/main/en/index.php)\n1.

The manuscript contents follow the Carmelite usage as defined by the Ordinal of Sibert de Beka of 1312 with some additional feasts such as St. Wenceslaus and St. Ludmila, of particular significance to the tradition of Prague.\nKrak\u00f3w mss. 1-4 and the Wroc\u0142aw manuscript were revised in the middle of the eighteenth century for continuing use in the convent; one would suppose, therefore, that the medieval version of the chant was still in use up to that time. In the course of the revision several offices had palimpsest chants for newer feasts written over them, so that much of the original chant has been lost.\nThis manuscript contains two misbound pages. These leaves have been switched: the leaf with page-numbering \u201c101/102\u201d should follow the page numbered as \u201c118,\u201d and the leaf numbered as \u201c119/120\u201d should follow page 100.\nContributors to MS Description: JB (08/2006), ed.

Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

        "source_description": "<p>This book forms part of the &quot;opus tripartitum&quot; (including a gradual [1536] and a noted ferial psalter [1537] , that the Cologne printer Hero Alopecius (Fuchs) produced for the diocese of M\u00fcnster after the Anabaptists had destroyed many liturgical books in the city during their &quot;kingdom of a thousand years&quot; in 1534-35. It is a rich source of historia with plainchant texts and melodies that are unique, or nearly unique, to antiphoners and noted breviaries written for use in the diocese of M\u00fcnster. In addition to the office for St Liudger (Analecta Hymnica [AH] 26, no. 91), the first bishop of the diocese, one can single out the offices for St. Patroclus (not in AH), the Conversion of St. Paul (AH 28, no. 43), the Sending Forth of the Apostles (AH 5, no. 22), the Translation of the Three Kings (AH 5, no. 23), the Beheading of John the Baptist (AH 26, no. 51), Sts. Chrysanthus and Daria (AH 25, no. 73) and the Holy Lance (partly in AH 5, no. 7). All of these offices are part of a work in progress at the University of Cape Town that will include critical editions of the texts and melodies.<br /><br />The differentiae of each mode have been numbered with a two-digit system: an upper-case letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and a sequentially ordered numeral. The codes for differentiae and chants not found in CAO will be retained for the manuscript sources from the diocese of M\u00fcnster that are currently being indexed.<br /><br />Two breviary manuscript sources, containing the cathedral liturgy of M\u00fcnster, were consulted in order to clarify Feast Name, Office and Position entries in the index for which the printed Antiphoner provides unclear or insufficient information: <i>M\u00fcnster, Nordrhein-Westf\u00e4lisches Staatsarchiv, Verein f\u00fcr Geschichte und Altertumskunde Westfalens, Abt. M\u00fcnster, Msc. 97 and Msc. 273</i> (D-M\u00dcsa MSS AV97 and AV273). The Fraterherren of M\u00fcnster wrote both of these volumes: the former (1464), containing the winter and spring parts, was written for Hermann von Langen, Dean of the M\u00fcnster cathedral, while the latter (ca. 1480), containing the summer and winter parts was written for a canon of the same cathedral.</p>",

        "source_description": "Spanish-language inscriptions and annotations suggest this antiphoner\u2019s origin and use in Spain, although no date or place of origin or use is recorded or known. Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

        "source_description": "This manuscript was likely created for use at the male collegiate church of St. Mary in Aachen, as evidenced by the saints' feasts included in the antiphoner. Of particular note is the inclusion of the office for Adalbert of Prague, Bishop and Martyr (celebrated April 23), also known as the office Ad festa pretiosi. As Jakub Kubieniec writes in his article on the office (see Bibliography), it appears in several manuscripts from Aachen beginning in the twelfth century, as well as in manuscripts from Krak\u00f3w. Kubieniec challenges an earlier theory that the office originated in Krak\u00f3w, as evidenced from an antiphoner from the Krak\u00f3w Cathedral (c. 1320, MS. 52), and argues that the Aachen antiphoner contains an earlier version of the office.</br></br>\nThe text of the manuscript is Roman miniscule and Gothic text in black ink, with early and high Gothic initials in blue and red ink with filigree, and plant and animal motifs (e.g., ff. 59v, 44v, 27r). Additions to the manuscript were made in the thirteenth to fifteenth century in various hands (f. 364r-406v).</br></br>\nDifferentiae are indexed by their last note and an arbitrarily assigned number. Slight variations are indicated by a lowercase suffix (e.g., D2, D2a).",

        "source_description": "NZ-Wt MSR-03 is likely the second of a pair of antiphonals as it contains the <i>pars aestiva,</i> that is, the liturgical material from Easter Day forward, both Temporale and Sanctorale. The volume containing the <i>pars hiemalis</i> is yet to be found. <br/>\nInside the front cover of the binding on the front pastedown is the 15th-century ownership inscription, \u201cLiber co[n]vent[us] s[anc]ti monaliu[m] s[anc]te Agathe v[ir]gi[ni]s Am[er]sfor.e.\u201d Thus, the provenance of this book has been ascribed to the Augustinian abbey of the Sisters of the Common Life at Amersfoort. The association of NZ-Wt MSR-03 with a women\u2019s house is further supported by the inclusion near the end of the manuscript of additional Marian chants and some less-common Offices for female saints. In more recent years, this manuscript was acquired by Albert Clemas (1880?-1956) and later sold by him in 1933 to the British and Foreign Bible Society of New Zealand. In 1978, it was deposited into the Alexander Turnbull Library, now a division of the National Library of New Zealand, on permanent loan from the Bible Society.<br/>\nJust beneath the 15th-century inscription on the front pastedown appears \u201cHymns Versicles and antiphons\u201d in pencil in a modern cursive hand. The first flyleaf contains more of the same hand in pencil and a cutting from an English bookseller\u2019s catalogue that provides a different interpretation of the ownership inscription on the pastedown. The second front flyleaf is blank (recto and verso), and there is a single chant on the recto side of the third front flyleaf (indexed as f. 000r). There are no apparent folio numbers, so the inventory follows the numbering of the digital images posted online by the library. The main body of the manuscript contains 190 paper leaves (ff. 001r-190r). The following are blank: ff. 162v, 169v, 170r, 170v, and 190v.<br/>\nThe binding consists of plain, brown, limp vellum with a fold-over flap and repaired/renewed ties that extend around the entire book. The paper in this manuscript contain numerous watermarks: at least 11 different watermarks and variants are indicated in the library catalogue description, including versions of Briquet 3625 (1480), 6112-6113 (similar types all later 15th century), 8623 (1484), 8655-8682 (all later 15th century), 9182 (1467), 12478 (1481), and 14187-14213 (all later 15th century). The collation of leaves has the following organization: i-vi\u00b9\u2070, vii-xviii\u2078, xix\u2076, xx\u2078, xxi\u2078+\u00b2, xxii\u00b9\u2070, with three different series of faint contemporary leaf signatures from \u201cA\u201d to \u201c[m]\u201d on gatherings 1-13 (ff. 000r-116v), \u201c[a]\u201d to \u201cF\u201d on gathering 14-19 (ff. 117r-162v), and from \u201ca\u201d to \u201c[c]\u201d on gatherings 20-22 (ff. 163r-190v). The gatherings are numbered in pencil in the upper-right-hand corners of the recto sides (\u201c1\u201d on f. 000r, \u201c2\u201d on 011r, \u201c3\u201d on f. 021r, \u201c4\u201d on f. 031r, \u201c5\u201d on f. 041r, \u201c6\u201d on f. 051r, \u201c7\u201d on f. 061r, \u201c8\u201d on f. 069r, \u201c9\u201d on f. 077r, \u201c10\u201d on f. 085r, \u201c11\u201d on f. 093r, \u201c12\u201d on f. 101r, \u201c13\u201d on f. 109r, \u201c14\u201d on f. 117r, \u201c15\u201d on f. 125r, \u201c16\u201d on f. 133r, \u201c17\u201d on f. 141r, \u201c18\u201d on f. 149r, \u201c19\u201d on f. 157r, \u201c20\u201d on f. 163r, \u201c21\u201d on f. 171r, \u201c22\u201d on f. 181r).<br/>\nThe leaves are ruled in faint plummet, with six systems per folio side of 4-line inked staves with F- and C-clefs. The notation is Hufnagelschrift. The black/brown text script is in a Gothic liturgical hand, and the library catalogue identifies three main scribes (changing after ff. 116 and 162, corresponding with changes of runs of signatures). Ff. 091v-092r appear to be in a slightly later hand with a different ink (now flaking off). Throughout the manuscript, rubrics are in red, and some liturgical directions are underlined in red. There are approximately 290 calligraphic initials in black, touched in red, infilled with black penwork (to f. 116 only) of which nearly fifty include human faces or profiles, mostly of monks or of grotesque unshaven figures spitting. Approximately 316 large initials are painted in red or occasionally in blue. Three large initials (c. 50 x 60 mm) are elaborately drawn in blue with penwork infilling and full-length marginal flourishing in red partly infilled with a green wash; these mark the beginning of the Sanctorale (f. 001r), Common of the Saints (f. 092v) and Temporale f. 117r). On f. 001r and 092v the border terminates in a bushy-tailed dragon. Space for a fourth large initial for Pentecost (f. 136r) was left blank.",

        "source_description": "Since Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

        "source_description": "Since Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

        "source_description": "This manuscript consists of two parts. <u>The first part</u> (pp.1-428) is the oldest complete surviving Gradual with adiastematic neumes. Besides the Mass chants, in order throughout the liturgical year, there are appendices of <i>Alleluia</i> verses, hymns, antiphons for several occasions, and a neumed <i>versicularium</i> (<i>Psalmi ad Communionem</i>). The first page(s) are missing; the Gradual starts with the Alleluia <i>Ostende nobis Domine</i> of the 1st Sunday in Advent. In the Gradual, the Temporale and Sanctorale are not separated. Verses for the offertories are given with neumes. The Gradual section is known for the extraordinary usage of <i>litterae significativae</i> within the neume notation.\n</br>\n<u>The second part</u> of the codex (pp. 429-599) contains sequences by Notker from St. Gall (ca. 840-912); throughout this section the text forms the main body of each page with adiastematic neumes in the margins. \n</br>\nThe codex was written in Einsiedeln, likely for the third abbot of the cloister, Gregor the Englishman. Some chants are neumed by later hands. The pages of Einsiedeln 121 are numbered with a modern hand in black ink in the upper outside corners of the leaves (pp. 1-600); there is no original numbering. The manuscript includes various illuminated letters, mostly in the Gradual, and three large illustrations that cover the entire page: an ornamented monogram (p. 204: <i>In die sancto Resurrectionis Domini ad Missam</i>), the ornamented \u201cResurrexi\u201d of Easter Sunday\u2019s Introit (p. 205), and another ornamented monogram (p. 436: <i>In nomine Domini incipit Lyber Ymnorum Notkeri</i>).",

Although an important Premonstratensian manuscript of the Jurassian region, it is likely that the manuscript originated from north-eastern France and was a gift to Bellelay Abbey at its founding. To that effect, the Messine notation is not typical of the Jurassian region, and the manuscript includes many erasures and corrections suggesting adaptation to local practice. Furthermore, only one saint in the Sanctorale is particular to the Jurassian region, St. Imer (Imier), and even this seems to be a later addition from the beginning of the 13th century. The manuscript may have been a gift from the mother house of Lac de Joux Abbey, itself a sister abbey to Saint-Martin de Laon in north-eastern France. ",

BKT.006 (the \u2018Tsgrooten Antiphoner\u2019) was commissioned in 1522 by Antonius Tsgrooten, abbot of the Premonstratensian abbey of Tongerlo, located in the province of Antwerp. The manuscript is a summer volume, holding the chants for the divine office from Easter up until the Sunday before Advent. The corresponding winter volume\u2014with chants from Advent to Holy Week\u2014is in the British Library (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15427). Also commissioned in 1522 was a hymnary (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15426). These three manuscripts are all of similar dimensions, compilation structures, and styles. \n\nAll three manuscripts are of interest for the illuminated miniatures and border flourishing, executed in the Ghent-Bruges style, with particularly elaborate border pages for key feasts. The scribe responsible for the manuscripts, Franciscus van Weert, was a prolific copyist for other Premonstratensian manuscripts, including those at the nearby abbeys of Park and Averbode. \n\nB-Gu, Hs. BKT.006\u2014along with its companion volumes\u2014was heavily edited in the seventeenth century to adhere more consistently with Premonstratensian chant reform. These editorial changes accord with other manuscripts from the order, and conform with the new edition of the Antiphonarium Praemonstratense published by Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers (Paris, 1680). These changes manifest in the erasures of older notes and text, and overwriting in a newer hand. Some chants and rubrics are struck through entirely, whereas new additions and notes are inserted interlinearly or in available margin space.\n\nPrior to the abbey\u2019s dissolution during the French Revolution, the manuscript was gifted to the House of Merode. The Flemish Government bought the manuscript in 2008, after which it was brought to its current home at the Universiteit Gent.",

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII.

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

The other five manuscripts are:\n    Krak\u00f3w, Klastor OO. Karmelit\u00f3w na Piasku (Carmelite Convent), Ms.2 (rkp. Perg. 14)\n    Krak\u00f3w, Klastor OO.

Perg. = R\u0119kopis Pergament; The manuscripts still remaining at the Carmelite convent in Krak\u00f3w have been numbered (Ms. 1 - Ms. 5) chronologically, earliest to latest, by James Boyce. The \"r\u0119kopis\" (Polish for 'manuscript') numbers assigned by Jerzy Go\u0142os, who ordered the sources by size from largest to smallest, have been retained in parentheses with the abbreviation \"rkp\".]\nThe Carmelite convent in Prague was founded from Germany in 1347, and then the Krak\u00f3w convent was founded from Prague. The manuscript contents follow the Carmelite usage as defined by the Ordinal of Sibert de Beka of 1312 with some additional feasts such as St. Wenceslaus and St. Ludmila, of particular significance to the tradition of Prague.\nKrak\u00f3w mss. 1-4 and the Wroc\u0142aw manuscript were revised in the middle of the eighteenth century for continuing use in the convent; one would suppose, therefore, that the medieval version of the chant was still in use up to that time. In the course of the revision several offices had palimpsest chants for newer feasts written over them, so that much of the original chant has been lost.\nThis manuscript contains two misbound pages. These leaves have been switched: the leaf with page-numbering \u201c101/102\u201d should follow the page numbered as \u201c118,\u201d and the leaf numbered as \u201c119/120\u201d should follow page 100.\nContributors to MS Description: JB (08/2006), ed.

The volume containing the <i>pars hiemalis</i> is yet to be found. <br/>\nInside the front cover of the binding on the front pastedown is the 15th-century ownership inscription, \u201cLiber co[n]vent[us] s[anc]ti monaliu[m] s[anc]te Agathe v[ir]gi[ni]s Am[er]sfor.e.\u201d Thus, the provenance of this book has been ascribed to the Augustinian abbey of the Sisters of the Common Life at Amersfoort. The association of NZ-Wt MSR-03 with a women\u2019s house is further supported by the inclusion near the end of the manuscript of additional Marian chants and some less-common Offices for female saints. In more recent years, this manuscript was acquired by Albert Clemas (1880?-1956) and later sold by him in 1933 to the British and Foreign Bible Society of New Zealand. In 1978, it was deposited into the Alexander Turnbull Library, now a division of the National Library of New Zealand, on permanent loan from the Bible Society.<br/>\nJust beneath the 15th-century inscription on the front pastedown appears \u201cHymns Versicles and antiphons\u201d in pencil in a modern cursive hand. The first flyleaf contains more of the same hand in pencil and a cutting from an English bookseller\u2019s catalogue that provides a different interpretation of the ownership inscription on the pastedown. The second front flyleaf is blank (recto and verso), and there is a single chant on the recto side of the third front flyleaf (indexed as f. 000r). There are no apparent folio numbers, so the inventory follows the numbering of the digital images posted online by the library. The main body of the manuscript contains 190 paper leaves (ff. 001r-190r). The following are blank: ff. 162v, 169v, 170r, 170v, and 190v.<br/>\nThe binding consists of plain, brown, limp vellum with a fold-over flap and repaired/renewed ties that extend around the entire book. The paper in this manuscript contain numerous watermarks: at least 11 different watermarks and variants are indicated in the library catalogue description, including versions of Briquet 3625 (1480), 6112-6113 (similar types all later 15th century), 8623 (1484), 8655-8682 (all later 15th century), 9182 (1467), 12478 (1481), and 14187-14213 (all later 15th century). The collation of leaves has the following organization: i-vi\u00b9\u2070, vii-xviii\u2078, xix\u2076, xx\u2078, xxi\u2078+\u00b2, xxii\u00b9\u2070, with three different series of faint contemporary leaf signatures from \u201cA\u201d to \u201c[m]\u201d on gatherings 1-13 (ff. 000r-116v), \u201c[a]\u201d to \u201cF\u201d on gathering 14-19 (ff. 117r-162v), and from \u201ca\u201d to \u201c[c]\u201d on gatherings 20-22 (ff. 163r-190v). The gatherings are numbered in pencil in the upper-right-hand corners of the recto sides (\u201c1\u201d on f. 000r, \u201c2\u201d on 011r, \u201c3\u201d on f. 021r, \u201c4\u201d on f. 031r, \u201c5\u201d on f. 041r, \u201c6\u201d on f. 051r, \u201c7\u201d on f. 061r, \u201c8\u201d on f. 069r, \u201c9\u201d on f. 077r, \u201c10\u201d on f. 085r, \u201c11\u201d on f. 093r, \u201c12\u201d on f. 101r, \u201c13\u201d on f. 109r, \u201c14\u201d on f. 117r, \u201c15\u201d on f. 125r, \u201c16\u201d on f. 133r, \u201c17\u201d on f. 141r, \u201c18\u201d on f. 149r, \u201c19\u201d on f. 157r, \u201c20\u201d on f. 163r, \u201c21\u201d on f. 171r, \u201c22\u201d on f. 181r).<br/>\nThe leaves are ruled in faint plummet, with six systems per folio side of 4-line inked staves with F- and C-clefs. The notation is Hufnagelschrift. The black/brown text script is in a Gothic liturgical hand, and the library catalogue identifies three main scribes (changing after ff. 116 and 162, corresponding with changes of runs of signatures). Ff. 091v-092r appear to be in a slightly later hand with a different ink (now flaking off). Throughout the manuscript, rubrics are in red, and some liturgical directions are underlined in red. There are approximately 290 calligraphic initials in black, touched in red, infilled with black penwork (to f. 116 only) of which nearly fifty include human faces or profiles, mostly of monks or of grotesque unshaven figures spitting. Approximately 316 large initials are painted in red or occasionally in blue. Three large initials (c. 50 x 60 mm) are elaborately drawn in blue with penwork infilling and full-length marginal flourishing in red partly infilled with a green wash; these mark the beginning of the Sanctorale (f. 001r), Common of the Saints (f. 092v) and Temporale f. 117r). On f. 001r and 092v the border terminates in a bushy-tailed dragon. Space for a fourth large initial for Pentecost (f. 136r) was left blank.",

Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

The gatherings are numbered in pencil in the upper-right-hand corners of the recto sides (\u201c1\u201d on f. 000r, \u201c2\u201d on 011r, \u201c3\u201d on f. 021r, \u201c4\u201d on f. 031r, \u201c5\u201d on f. 041r, \u201c6\u201d on f. 051r, \u201c7\u201d on f. 061r, \u201c8\u201d on f. 069r, \u201c9\u201d on f. 077r, \u201c10\u201d on f. 085r, \u201c11\u201d on f. 093r, \u201c12\u201d on f. 101r, \u201c13\u201d on f. 109r, \u201c14\u201d on f. 117r, \u201c15\u201d on f. 125r, \u201c16\u201d on f. 133r, \u201c17\u201d on f. 141r, \u201c18\u201d on f. 149r, \u201c19\u201d on f. 157r, \u201c20\u201d on f. 163r, \u201c21\u201d on f. 171r, \u201c22\u201d on f. 181r).<br/>\nThe leaves are ruled in faint plummet, with six systems per folio side of 4-line inked staves with F- and C-clefs. The notation is Hufnagelschrift. The black/brown text script is in a Gothic liturgical hand, and the library catalogue identifies three main scribes (changing after ff. 116 and 162, corresponding with changes of runs of signatures). Ff. 091v-092r appear to be in a slightly later hand with a different ink (now flaking off). Throughout the manuscript, rubrics are in red, and some liturgical directions are underlined in red. There are approximately 290 calligraphic initials in black, touched in red, infilled with black penwork (to f. 116 only) of which nearly fifty include human faces or profiles, mostly of monks or of grotesque unshaven figures spitting. Approximately 316 large initials are painted in red or occasionally in blue. Three large initials (c. 50 x 60 mm) are elaborately drawn in blue with penwork infilling and full-length marginal flourishing in red partly infilled with a green wash; these mark the beginning of the Sanctorale (f. 001r), Common of the Saints (f. 092v) and Temporale f. 117r). On f. 001r and 092v the border terminates in a bushy-tailed dragon. Space for a fourth large initial for Pentecost (f. 136r) was left blank.",

        "source_description": "Since Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

        "source_description": "B-Gu, Hs. BKT.006 (the \u2018Tsgrooten Antiphoner\u2019) was commissioned in 1522 by Antonius Tsgrooten, abbot of the Premonstratensian abbey of Tongerlo, located in the province of Antwerp. The manuscript is a summer volume, holding the chants for the divine office from Easter up until the Sunday before Advent. The corresponding winter volume\u2014with chants from Advent to Holy Week\u2014is in the British Library (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15427). Also commissioned in 1522 was a hymnary (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15426). These three manuscripts are all of similar dimensions, compilation structures, and styles. \n\nAll three manuscripts are of interest for the illuminated miniatures and border flourishing, executed in the Ghent-Bruges style, with particularly elaborate border pages for key feasts. The scribe responsible for the manuscripts, Franciscus van Weert, was a prolific copyist for other Premonstratensian manuscripts, including those at the nearby abbeys of Park and Averbode. \n\nB-Gu, Hs. BKT.006\u2014along with its companion volumes\u2014was heavily edited in the seventeenth century to adhere more consistently with Premonstratensian chant reform. These editorial changes accord with other manuscripts from the order, and conform with the new edition of the Antiphonarium Praemonstratense published by Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers (Paris, 1680). These changes manifest in the erasures of older notes and text, and overwriting in a newer hand. Some chants and rubrics are struck through entirely, whereas new additions and notes are inserted interlinearly or in available margin space.\n\nPrior to the abbey\u2019s dissolution during the French Revolution, the manuscript was gifted to the House of Merode. The Flemish Government bought the manuscript in 2008, after which it was brought to its current home at the Universiteit Gent.",

        "source_description": "Spanish-language inscriptions and annotations suggest this antiphoner\u2019s origin and use in Spain, although no date or place of origin or use is recorded or known. Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

Hildegardis (ff. 1\u2013121v); Liber Viarum Dei S. Elisabeth de Schoenau (ff. 121\u2013152v); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (ff. 153\u2013170v); and an untitled dialogue between a priest and the devil (ff. 170\u2013173v). Only the portion of the codex with music, known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations), is inventoried in the Cantus Database.\n\nHildegard composed musical works for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia, which survive mainly in two extant sources, the Dendermonde and Wiesbaden codices.\n\nThe Dendermonde codex was completed before Nov. 1, 1176 in the scriptorium of the Rupertsberg cloister and sent to the Cistercian abbey of Villers in Brabant, Belgium as indicated by the owner\u2019s mark on f. 173v, \u201cLiber s[an]c[t]e Ma[rie de] Villari\u201d (The Benedictine Abbey of Villers). The codex was transferred to the abbey of Affligem in the seventeenth century, at which point \u201cMonasterii Haffligemensis\u201d was marked on f. 1. In 1796, the monks were expelled from Affligem due to the French Revolution, and in 1837, the abbey moved to Dendermonde. Since then, the manuscript has been held by the St. Pieters & Paulusabdij abbey. The codex was rebound in the eighteenth century with white paper flyleaves and \u201cM.S. OPERA HILDEGARDI [sic] VIRGINS\u201d was stamped on its spine. There are also pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand corners in a modern hand.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8).

        "source_description": "Since Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8).

Kubieniec challenges an earlier theory that the office originated in Krak\u00f3w, as evidenced from an antiphoner from the Krak\u00f3w Cathedral (c. 1320, MS. 52), and argues that the Aachen antiphoner contains an earlier version of the office.</br></br>\nThe text of the manuscript is Roman miniscule and Gothic text in black ink, with early and high Gothic initials in blue and red ink with filigree, and plant and animal motifs (e.g., ff. 59v, 44v, 27r).

        "source_description": "Since Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

Only the portion of the codex with music, known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations), is inventoried in the Cantus Database.\n\nHildegard composed musical works for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia, which survive mainly in two extant sources, the Dendermonde and Wiesbaden codices.\n\nThe Dendermonde codex was completed before Nov. 1, 1176 in the scriptorium of the Rupertsberg cloister and sent to the Cistercian abbey of Villers in Brabant, Belgium as indicated by the owner\u2019s mark on f. 173v, \u201cLiber s[an]c[t]e Ma[rie de] Villari\u201d (The Benedictine Abbey of Villers). The codex was transferred to the abbey of Affligem in the seventeenth century, at which point \u201cMonasterii Haffligemensis\u201d was marked on f. 1. In 1796, the monks were expelled from Affligem due to the French Revolution, and in 1837, the abbey moved to Dendermonde. Since then, the manuscript has been held by the St. Pieters & Paulusabdij abbey. The codex was rebound in the eighteenth century with white paper flyleaves and \u201cM.S. OPERA HILDEGARDI [sic] VIRGINS\u201d was stamped on its spine. There are also pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand corners in a modern hand.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

        "source_description": "Since Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

Although an important Premonstratensian manuscript of the Jurassian region, it is likely that the manuscript originated from north-eastern France and was a gift to Bellelay Abbey at its founding. To that effect, the Messine notation is not typical of the Jurassian region, and the manuscript includes many erasures and corrections suggesting adaptation to local practice. Furthermore, only one saint in the Sanctorale is particular to the Jurassian region, St. Imer (Imier), and even this seems to be a later addition from the beginning of the 13th century. The manuscript may have been a gift from the mother house of Lac de Joux Abbey, itself a sister abbey to Saint-Martin de Laon in north-eastern France. ",

        "source_description": "The Dendermonde codex contains works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179) and Elisabeth of Sch\u00f6nau (1129-1165), as well as one anonymous work: Liber Vitae Meritorum S. Hildegardis (ff. 1\u2013121v); Liber Viarum Dei S. Elisabeth de Schoenau (ff. 121\u2013152v); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (ff. 153\u2013170v); and an untitled dialogue between a priest and the devil (ff. 170\u2013173v). Only the portion of the codex with music, known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations), is inventoried in the Cantus Database.\n\nHildegard composed musical works for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia, which survive mainly in two extant sources, the Dendermonde and Wiesbaden codices.\n\nThe Dendermonde codex was completed before Nov. 1, 1176 in the scriptorium of the Rupertsberg cloister and sent to the Cistercian abbey of Villers in Brabant, Belgium as indicated by the owner\u2019s mark on f. 173v, \u201cLiber s[an]c[t]e Ma[rie de] Villari\u201d (The Benedictine Abbey of Villers). The codex was transferred to the abbey of Affligem in the seventeenth century, at which point \u201cMonasterii Haffligemensis\u201d was marked on f. 1. In 1796, the monks were expelled from Affligem due to the French Revolution, and in 1837, the abbey moved to Dendermonde. Since then, the manuscript has been held by the St. Pieters & Paulusabdij abbey. The codex was rebound in the eighteenth century with white paper flyleaves and \u201cM.S. OPERA HILDEGARDI [sic] VIRGINS\u201d was stamped on its spine. There are also pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand corners in a modern hand.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

Although an important Premonstratensian manuscript of the Jurassian region, it is likely that the manuscript originated from north-eastern France and was a gift to Bellelay Abbey at its founding. To that effect, the Messine notation is not typical of the Jurassian region, and the manuscript includes many erasures and corrections suggesting adaptation to local practice. Furthermore, only one saint in the Sanctorale is particular to the Jurassian region, St. Imer (Imier), and even this seems to be a later addition from the beginning of the 13th century. The manuscript may have been a gift from the mother house of Lac de Joux Abbey, itself a sister abbey to Saint-Martin de Laon in north-eastern France. ",

Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

Hildegardis (ff. 1\u2013121v); Liber Viarum Dei S. Elisabeth de Schoenau (ff. 121\u2013152v); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (ff. 153\u2013170v); and an untitled dialogue between a priest and the devil (ff. 170\u2013173v). Only the portion of the codex with music, known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations), is inventoried in the Cantus Database.\n\nHildegard composed musical works for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia, which survive mainly in two extant sources, the Dendermonde and Wiesbaden codices.\n\nThe Dendermonde codex was completed before Nov. 1, 1176 in the scriptorium of the Rupertsberg cloister and sent to the Cistercian abbey of Villers in Brabant, Belgium as indicated by the owner\u2019s mark on f. 173v, \u201cLiber s[an]c[t]e Ma[rie de] Villari\u201d (The Benedictine Abbey of Villers). The codex was transferred to the abbey of Affligem in the seventeenth century, at which point \u201cMonasterii Haffligemensis\u201d was marked on f. 1. In 1796, the monks were expelled from Affligem due to the French Revolution, and in 1837, the abbey moved to Dendermonde. Since then, the manuscript has been held by the St. Pieters & Paulusabdij abbey. The codex was rebound in the eighteenth century with white paper flyleaves and \u201cM.S. OPERA HILDEGARDI [sic] VIRGINS\u201d was stamped on its spine. There are also pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand corners in a modern hand.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

        "source_description": "B-Gu, Hs. BKT.006 (the \u2018Tsgrooten Antiphoner\u2019) was commissioned in 1522 by Antonius Tsgrooten, abbot of the Premonstratensian abbey of Tongerlo, located in the province of Antwerp. The manuscript is a summer volume, holding the chants for the divine office from Easter up until the Sunday before Advent. The corresponding winter volume\u2014with chants from Advent to Holy Week\u2014is in the British Library (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15427). Also commissioned in 1522 was a hymnary (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15426). These three manuscripts are all of similar dimensions, compilation structures, and styles. \n\nAll three manuscripts are of interest for the illuminated miniatures and border flourishing, executed in the Ghent-Bruges style, with particularly elaborate border pages for key feasts. The scribe responsible for the manuscripts, Franciscus van Weert, was a prolific copyist for other Premonstratensian manuscripts, including those at the nearby abbeys of Park and Averbode. \n\nB-Gu, Hs. BKT.006\u2014along with its companion volumes\u2014was heavily edited in the seventeenth century to adhere more consistently with Premonstratensian chant reform. These editorial changes accord with other manuscripts from the order, and conform with the new edition of the Antiphonarium Praemonstratense published by Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers (Paris, 1680). These changes manifest in the erasures of older notes and text, and overwriting in a newer hand. Some chants and rubrics are struck through entirely, whereas new additions and notes are inserted interlinearly or in available margin space.\n\nPrior to the abbey\u2019s dissolution during the French Revolution, the manuscript was gifted to the House of Merode. The Flemish Government bought the manuscript in 2008, after which it was brought to its current home at the Universiteit Gent.",

Of particular note is the inclusion of the office for Adalbert of Prague, Bishop and Martyr (celebrated April 23), also known as the office Ad festa pretiosi. As Jakub Kubieniec writes in his article on the office (see Bibliography), it appears in several manuscripts from Aachen beginning in the twelfth century, as well as in manuscripts from Krak\u00f3w. Kubieniec challenges an earlier theory that the office originated in Krak\u00f3w, as evidenced from an antiphoner from the Krak\u00f3w Cathedral (c. 1320, MS. 52), and argues that the Aachen antiphoner contains an earlier version of the office.</br></br>\nThe text of the manuscript is Roman miniscule and Gothic text in black ink, with early and high Gothic initials in blue and red ink with filigree, and plant and animal motifs (e.g., ff. 59v, 44v, 27r). Additions to the manuscript were made in the thirteenth to fifteenth century in various hands (f. 364r-406v).</br></br>\nDifferentiae are indexed by their last note and an arbitrarily assigned number.

        "source_description": "This manuscript was likely created for use at the male collegiate church of St. Mary in Aachen, as evidenced by the saints' feasts included in the antiphoner. Of particular note is the inclusion of the office for Adalbert of Prague, Bishop and Martyr (celebrated April 23), also known as the office Ad festa pretiosi. As Jakub Kubieniec writes in his article on the office (see Bibliography), it appears in several manuscripts from Aachen beginning in the twelfth century, as well as in manuscripts from Krak\u00f3w. Kubieniec challenges an earlier theory that the office originated in Krak\u00f3w, as evidenced from an antiphoner from the Krak\u00f3w Cathedral (c. 1320, MS. 52), and argues that the Aachen antiphoner contains an earlier version of the office.</br></br>\nThe text of the manuscript is Roman miniscule and Gothic text in black ink, with early and high Gothic initials in blue and red ink with filigree, and plant and animal motifs (e.g., ff. 59v, 44v, 27r). Additions to the manuscript were made in the thirteenth to fifteenth century in various hands (f. 364r-406v).</br></br>\nDifferentiae are indexed by their last note and an arbitrarily assigned number. Slight variations are indicated by a lowercase suffix (e.g., D2, D2a).",

        "source_description": "Since Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

Hildegardis (ff. 1\u2013121v); Liber Viarum Dei S. Elisabeth de Schoenau (ff. 121\u2013152v); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (ff. 153\u2013170v); and an untitled dialogue between a priest and the devil (ff. 170\u2013173v). Only the portion of the codex with music, known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations), is inventoried in the Cantus Database.\n\nHildegard composed musical works for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia, which survive mainly in two extant sources, the Dendermonde and Wiesbaden codices.\n\nThe Dendermonde codex was completed before Nov. 1, 1176 in the scriptorium of the Rupertsberg cloister and sent to the Cistercian abbey of Villers in Brabant, Belgium as indicated by the owner\u2019s mark on f. 173v, \u201cLiber s[an]c[t]e Ma[rie de] Villari\u201d (The Benedictine Abbey of Villers). The codex was transferred to the abbey of Affligem in the seventeenth century, at which point \u201cMonasterii Haffligemensis\u201d was marked on f. 1. In 1796, the monks were expelled from Affligem due to the French Revolution, and in 1837, the abbey moved to Dendermonde. Since then, the manuscript has been held by the St. Pieters & Paulusabdij abbey. The codex was rebound in the eighteenth century with white paper flyleaves and \u201cM.S. OPERA HILDEGARDI [sic] VIRGINS\u201d was stamped on its spine. There are also pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand corners in a modern hand.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

        "source_description": "This manuscript is one part of a four-volume antiphoner comprised of HR-HF Cod. C, D, E, and F, written by the same scribe. This manuscript contains the first part of the Temporale, from the first Sunday of Advent to the second Sunday after Epiphany. The manuscripts are not numbered in liturgical order, as their connection was not recognized at the time of cataloguing.\n\nAlthough now held at a Dominican monastery (in the library of the monastery of Friars Minor in Dubrovnik, Croatia), the manuscripts are of Franciscan origin, as described by Ana \u010cizmi\u0107, despite not including material for the feasts of St. Francis, St. Anthony of Padua, and St. Clare. A fourteenth-century antiphoner from a nearby Franciscan monastery in Ston also does not include the feasts for these saints, suggesting that this antiphoner is in concordance with the regional rite of Bosnian Franciscan Friars. An inscription in Codex C confirms that the manuscripts were used by the Franciscan friars in Dubrovnik: \u201cTABULA OFFICIORUM HUIUS ANTIPHONARII SPECTANS AD CHORUM SANCTI FRANCISCI RAGUSII [Dubrovnik].\u201d\n\nA psalter, now also held in the Franjeva\u010dki Samostan in Dubrovnik (Codex B Nr. 1), was written in a similar hand and bears the colophon: \u201cExplicit psalterium secundum ritum romane ecclesie. Fratrum sancta marie gratiarum de venetiis. Ordinis obseruatine eximii doctoris sancti hieronymi, scriptum per me uenc fratrem ludouicum ferra eiusdem ordinis professum. Anno domini MCCCC nonaginta die sabb (\u2026).\u201d This inscription reveals the provenance of the psalter, the scribe (friar Ludovico Ferra), and year of completion (1449). While the antiphoner was not written by the same scribe, as evidenced by slight differences in majuscule letters, it likely also dates from the second half of the fifteenth century, possibly also from an Italian scriptorium.\n\n<i>Differentiae</i> are identified within each mode by their last note and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g., G1, D2, F1, etc. Minor variations are recognized by an alphabetic suffix, e.g. G1b, A1a, F1a, etc.",

BKT.006 (the \u2018Tsgrooten Antiphoner\u2019) was commissioned in 1522 by Antonius Tsgrooten, abbot of the Premonstratensian abbey of Tongerlo, located in the province of Antwerp. The manuscript is a summer volume, holding the chants for the divine office from Easter up until the Sunday before Advent. The corresponding winter volume\u2014with chants from Advent to Holy Week\u2014is in the British Library (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15427). Also commissioned in 1522 was a hymnary (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15426). These three manuscripts are all of similar dimensions, compilation structures, and styles. \n\nAll three manuscripts are of interest for the illuminated miniatures and border flourishing, executed in the Ghent-Bruges style, with particularly elaborate border pages for key feasts. The scribe responsible for the manuscripts, Franciscus van Weert, was a prolific copyist for other Premonstratensian manuscripts, including those at the nearby abbeys of Park and Averbode. \n\nB-Gu, Hs. BKT.006\u2014along with its companion volumes\u2014was heavily edited in the seventeenth century to adhere more consistently with Premonstratensian chant reform. These editorial changes accord with other manuscripts from the order, and conform with the new edition of the Antiphonarium Praemonstratense published by Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers (Paris, 1680). These changes manifest in the erasures of older notes and text, and overwriting in a newer hand. Some chants and rubrics are struck through entirely, whereas new additions and notes are inserted interlinearly or in available margin space.\n\nPrior to the abbey\u2019s dissolution during the French Revolution, the manuscript was gifted to the House of Merode. The Flemish Government bought the manuscript in 2008, after which it was brought to its current home at the Universiteit Gent.",

        "source_description": "NZ-Wt MSR-03 is likely the second of a pair of antiphonals as it contains the <i>pars aestiva,</i> that is, the liturgical material from Easter Day forward, both Temporale and Sanctorale. The volume containing the <i>pars hiemalis</i> is yet to be found. <br/>\nInside the front cover of the binding on the front pastedown is the 15th-century ownership inscription, \u201cLiber co[n]vent[us] s[anc]ti monaliu[m] s[anc]te Agathe v[ir]gi[ni]s Am[er]sfor.e.\u201d Thus, the provenance of this book has been ascribed to the Augustinian abbey of the Sisters of the Common Life at Amersfoort. The association of NZ-Wt MSR-03 with a women\u2019s house is further supported by the inclusion near the end of the manuscript of additional Marian chants and some less-common Offices for female saints. In more recent years, this manuscript was acquired by Albert Clemas (1880?-1956) and later sold by him in 1933 to the British and Foreign Bible Society of New Zealand. In 1978, it was deposited into the Alexander Turnbull Library, now a division of the National Library of New Zealand, on permanent loan from the Bible Society.<br/>\nJust beneath the 15th-century inscription on the front pastedown appears \u201cHymns Versicles and antiphons\u201d in pencil in a modern cursive hand. The first flyleaf contains more of the same hand in pencil and a cutting from an English bookseller\u2019s catalogue that provides a different interpretation of the ownership inscription on the pastedown. The second front flyleaf is blank (recto and verso), and there is a single chant on the recto side of the third front flyleaf (indexed as f. 000r). There are no apparent folio numbers, so the inventory follows the numbering of the digital images posted online by the library. The main body of the manuscript contains 190 paper leaves (ff. 001r-190r). The following are blank: ff. 162v, 169v, 170r, 170v, and 190v.<br/>\nThe binding consists of plain, brown, limp vellum with a fold-over flap and repaired/renewed ties that extend around the entire book. The paper in this manuscript contain numerous watermarks: at least 11 different watermarks and variants are indicated in the library catalogue description, including versions of Briquet 3625 (1480), 6112-6113 (similar types all later 15th century), 8623 (1484), 8655-8682 (all later 15th century), 9182 (1467), 12478 (1481), and 14187-14213 (all later 15th century). The collation of leaves has the following organization: i-vi\u00b9\u2070, vii-xviii\u2078, xix\u2076, xx\u2078, xxi\u2078+\u00b2, xxii\u00b9\u2070, with three different series of faint contemporary leaf signatures from \u201cA\u201d to \u201c[m]\u201d on gatherings 1-13 (ff. 000r-116v), \u201c[a]\u201d to \u201cF\u201d on gathering 14-19 (ff. 117r-162v), and from \u201ca\u201d to \u201c[c]\u201d on gatherings 20-22 (ff. 163r-190v). The gatherings are numbered in pencil in the upper-right-hand corners of the recto sides (\u201c1\u201d on f. 000r, \u201c2\u201d on 011r, \u201c3\u201d on f. 021r, \u201c4\u201d on f. 031r, \u201c5\u201d on f. 041r, \u201c6\u201d on f. 051r, \u201c7\u201d on f. 061r, \u201c8\u201d on f. 069r, \u201c9\u201d on f. 077r, \u201c10\u201d on f. 085r, \u201c11\u201d on f. 093r, \u201c12\u201d on f. 101r, \u201c13\u201d on f. 109r, \u201c14\u201d on f. 117r, \u201c15\u201d on f. 125r, \u201c16\u201d on f. 133r, \u201c17\u201d on f. 141r, \u201c18\u201d on f. 149r, \u201c19\u201d on f. 157r, \u201c20\u201d on f. 163r, \u201c21\u201d on f. 171r, \u201c22\u201d on f. 181r).<br/>\nThe leaves are ruled in faint plummet, with six systems per folio side of 4-line inked staves with F- and C-clefs. The notation is Hufnagelschrift. The black/brown text script is in a Gothic liturgical hand, and the library catalogue identifies three main scribes (changing after ff. 116 and 162, corresponding with changes of runs of signatures). Ff. 091v-092r appear to be in a slightly later hand with a different ink (now flaking off). Throughout the manuscript, rubrics are in red, and some liturgical directions are underlined in red. There are approximately 290 calligraphic initials in black, touched in red, infilled with black penwork (to f. 116 only) of which nearly fifty include human faces or profiles, mostly of monks or of grotesque unshaven figures spitting. Approximately 316 large initials are painted in red or occasionally in blue. Three large initials (c. 50 x 60 mm) are elaborately drawn in blue with penwork infilling and full-length marginal flourishing in red partly infilled with a green wash; these mark the beginning of the Sanctorale (f. 001r), Common of the Saints (f. 092v) and Temporale f. 117r). On f. 001r and 092v the border terminates in a bushy-tailed dragon. Space for a fourth large initial for Pentecost (f. 136r) was left blank.",

        "source_description": "Since Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

        "source_description": "The Wiesbaden codex contains the following textual and musical works by Hildegard of Bingen (1098\u20131179): Scivias (1v\u2013135v); Liber vitae meritorum (136r\u2013201v); Liber divinorum operum (202r\u2013308r); Episotla ad praelatos Moguntinos (308v\u2013317r); Vita Hildegardis (317r\u2013327v); Initium libri Epistolarum et orationum Sanctae Hildegardis (328r\u2013434r); Expositio Evangeliorum (434r\u2013461v); Lingua ignotae (461v\u2013464v); Litterae quas villarenses fratres post obitum domine nostre Hildegardis ad nos miserunt (464v\u2013465r); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (466r\u2013478v); Ordo virtutum (478v\u2013481v). The notated chants in the collection known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations) and the music drama, the Ordo virtutum (Order of the Virtues), are indexed in Cantus. The Dendermonde codex (MS 9) does not include the Ordo virtutum and is a less complete collection of the other chants. The Ordo virtutum is also found, however, in Additional Manuscript 15102, British Library, London (1487). Hildegard composed the Symphonia for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia. \n\nThe Wiesbaden codex is often called the Riesencodex (\"giant codex\") because the Wiesbaden library held two Hildegard manuscripts originally, one small and one large; the Riesencodex is the larger of the two (the other, MS 1, was a highly illuminated copy of Hildegard's Scivias, dating from her lifetime; it has been lost since WWII).\n\nAs the Wiesbaden codex includes the Vita Sanctae Hildegardis (Life of St. Hildegard) and the Literae Villarenses (Writings from Villers), the latter of which provides a reaction to Hildegard\u2019s death, it was likely copied c. 1180\u20131190, following Hildegard\u2019s death in 1179. It is possible that other parts of manuscript were written during Hildegard\u2019s lifetime and under her supervision as there are five different scribal hands in this manuscript. Parchment darkening on f. 466 and folio numbering irregularities suggest that the chant portion of the Wiesbaden codex (f. 466\u2013481) was kept apart for a period of time before its inclusion in the codex. At a contested date, pig-skin bound wooden covers with brass bindings and a chain at the back were added to the manuscript. There are pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand in a modern hand.\n\nThe chants in the Wiesbaden codex are physically divided by genre: the first gathering (f. 466\u2013472v) has responsories and antiphons; the second gathering (f. 473\u2013481v) has hymns, sequences, the Allelulia (473v), and the liturgical drama Ordo Virtutum. These two generic groups are divided by the Kyrie chant (f. 472v). There are also two thematic cycles organized hierarchically: the first from the Holy Trinity to the Dedication of the Church; and the second from the Holy Spirit and Mary to chants for Virgins and Widows.\n\nThe manuscript was held at the Rupertsberg monastery until the seventeenth century, when the nuns fled during the Thirty Years' War, taking the manuscript with them. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, it was kept at the daughter house that Hildegard had established across the Rhine in Eibingen in 1165. That monastery was ordered to be closed in the early nineteenth century, and the manuscript was transferred to the new state library in Wiesbaden, known today as the Hochschul- und Landesbibliothek RheinMain. It remained there until 1942 when it was sent to Dresden for safe-keeping during WWII. It was transferred to the Soviet sector of Berlin in late 1947 or early 1948, and was returned to Wiesbaden in March 1948, where it has remained.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8).

        "source_description": "Since Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

        "source_description": "Since Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

        "source_description": "Spanish-language inscriptions and annotations suggest this antiphoner\u2019s origin and use in Spain, although no date or place of origin or use is recorded or known. Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

        "source_description": "Since Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

Although an important Premonstratensian manuscript of the Jurassian region, it is likely that the manuscript originated from north-eastern France and was a gift to Bellelay Abbey at its founding. To that effect, the Messine notation is not typical of the Jurassian region, and the manuscript includes many erasures and corrections suggesting adaptation to local practice. Furthermore, only one saint in the Sanctorale is particular to the Jurassian region, St. Imer (Imier), and even this seems to be a later addition from the beginning of the 13th century. The manuscript may have been a gift from the mother house of Lac de Joux Abbey, itself a sister abbey to Saint-Martin de Laon in north-eastern France. ",

        "source_description": "B-Gu, Hs. BKT.006 (the \u2018Tsgrooten Antiphoner\u2019) was commissioned in 1522 by Antonius Tsgrooten, abbot of the Premonstratensian abbey of Tongerlo, located in the province of Antwerp. The manuscript is a summer volume, holding the chants for the divine office from Easter up until the Sunday before Advent. The corresponding winter volume\u2014with chants from Advent to Holy Week\u2014is in the British Library (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15427). Also commissioned in 1522 was a hymnary (GB-Lbl, Add. MS 15426). These three manuscripts are all of similar dimensions, compilation structures, and styles. \n\nAll three manuscripts are of interest for the illuminated miniatures and border flourishing, executed in the Ghent-Bruges style, with particularly elaborate border pages for key feasts. The scribe responsible for the manuscripts, Franciscus van Weert, was a prolific copyist for other Premonstratensian manuscripts, including those at the nearby abbeys of Park and Averbode. \n\nB-Gu, Hs. BKT.006\u2014along with its companion volumes\u2014was heavily edited in the seventeenth century to adhere more consistently with Premonstratensian chant reform. These editorial changes accord with other manuscripts from the order, and conform with the new edition of the Antiphonarium Praemonstratense published by Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers (Paris, 1680). These changes manifest in the erasures of older notes and text, and overwriting in a newer hand. Some chants and rubrics are struck through entirely, whereas new additions and notes are inserted interlinearly or in available margin space.\n\nPrior to the abbey\u2019s dissolution during the French Revolution, the manuscript was gifted to the House of Merode. The Flemish Government bought the manuscript in 2008, after which it was brought to its current home at the Universiteit Gent.",

        "source_description": "Since Didacus of Alcal\u00e1 was canonized in 1588 by Pope Sixtus V and this manuscript includes a feast in his name, this manuscript was probably copied at the end of the 16th century, after the arrival of the Franciscan commission to Quito in 1534 led by Jodocus Rickye and Pierre Gosseal who founded the Church and Convent. A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

See article by Janka Szendrei in bibliography; the comparison with south German sources, such as the Zwiefalten antiphoner (Karlsruhe, Badische Landesbibliothek - Musikabteilung, Aug. LX), seems to confirm it.\n*It is problematic that this antiphoner contains almost no rubrics.*  For example, the distribution of antiphons for the weekdays is not clear.  It is evident, however, from the size of the initials that the chants are organized, and are not merely unstructured lists of items.  The initials suggest a distribution of items for individual days of the week even when there are no explicit rubrics.  Since the Office of the St. George monastery is well documented \u2013 it is one of the most numerous manuscript collections in Czech libraries \u2013 concordances have been located in two breviaries from the same \u00e9poque: (See online images of these breviaries in the Manuscriptorium digital library: http://www.manuscriptorium.com/apps/main/en/index.php)\n1.

        "source_description": "At Bellelay Abbey from as early as 1160 until the suppression of the Abbey in 1797, the Bellelay Gradual has unknown origins. Although an important Premonstratensian manuscript of the Jurassian region, it is likely that the manuscript originated from north-eastern France and was a gift to Bellelay Abbey at its founding. To that effect, the Messine notation is not typical of the Jurassian region, and the manuscript includes many erasures and corrections suggesting adaptation to local practice. Furthermore, only one saint in the Sanctorale is particular to the Jurassian region, St. Imer (Imier), and even this seems to be a later addition from the beginning of the 13th century. The manuscript may have been a gift from the mother house of Lac de Joux Abbey, itself a sister abbey to Saint-Martin de Laon in north-eastern France. ",

        "indexing_notes": "The third flyleaf at the start of the manuscipt. A separate work from the main body of the manuscript. In a different (later) hand, both text script and notation. With unstated purpose, i.e., no rubrics. First initial \"G\" was not drawn. ",
        "source_description": "NZ-Wt MSR-03 is likely the second of a pair of antiphonals as it contains the <i>pars aestiva,</i> that is, the liturgical material from Easter Day forward, both Temporale and Sanctorale. The volume containing the <i>pars hiemalis</i> is yet to be found. <br/>\nInside the front cover of the binding on the front pastedown is the 15th-century ownership inscription, \u201cLiber co[n]vent[us] s[anc]ti monaliu[m] s[anc]te Agathe v[ir]gi[ni]s Am[er]sfor.e.\u201d Thus, the provenance of this book has been ascribed to the Augustinian abbey of the Sisters of the Common Life at Amersfoort. The association of NZ-Wt MSR-03 with a women\u2019s house is further supported by the inclusion near the end of the manuscript of additional Marian chants and some less-common Offices for female saints. In more recent years, this manuscript was acquired by Albert Clemas (1880?-1956) and later sold by him in 1933 to the British and Foreign Bible Society of New Zealand. In 1978, it was deposited into the Alexander Turnbull Library, now a division of the National Library of New Zealand, on permanent loan from the Bible Society.<br/>\nJust beneath the 15th-century inscription on the front pastedown appears \u201cHymns Versicles and antiphons\u201d in pencil in a modern cursive hand. The first flyleaf contains more of the same hand in pencil and a cutting from an English bookseller\u2019s catalogue that provides a different interpretation of the ownership inscription on the pastedown. The second front flyleaf is blank (recto and verso), and there is a single chant on the recto side of the third front flyleaf (indexed as f. 000r). There are no apparent folio numbers, so the inventory follows the numbering of the digital images posted online by the library. The main body of the manuscript contains 190 paper leaves (ff. 001r-190r). The following are blank: ff. 162v, 169v, 170r, 170v, and 190v.<br/>\nThe binding consists of plain, brown, limp vellum with a fold-over flap and repaired/renewed ties that extend around the entire book. The paper in this manuscript contain numerous watermarks: at least 11 different watermarks and variants are indicated in the library catalogue description, including versions of Briquet 3625 (1480), 6112-6113 (similar types all later 15th century), 8623 (1484), 8655-8682 (all later 15th century), 9182 (1467), 12478 (1481), and 14187-14213 (all later 15th century). The collation of leaves has the following organization: i-vi\u00b9\u2070, vii-xviii\u2078, xix\u2076, xx\u2078, xxi\u2078+\u00b2, xxii\u00b9\u2070, with three different series of faint contemporary leaf signatures from \u201cA\u201d to \u201c[m]\u201d on gatherings 1-13 (ff. 000r-116v), \u201c[a]\u201d to \u201cF\u201d on gathering 14-19 (ff. 117r-162v), and from \u201ca\u201d to \u201c[c]\u201d on gatherings 20-22 (ff. 163r-190v). The gatherings are numbered in pencil in the upper-right-hand corners of the recto sides (\u201c1\u201d on f. 000r, \u201c2\u201d on 011r, \u201c3\u201d on f. 021r, \u201c4\u201d on f. 031r, \u201c5\u201d on f. 041r, \u201c6\u201d on f. 051r, \u201c7\u201d on f. 061r, \u201c8\u201d on f. 069r, \u201c9\u201d on f. 077r, \u201c10\u201d on f. 085r, \u201c11\u201d on f. 093r, \u201c12\u201d on f. 101r, \u201c13\u201d on f. 109r, \u201c14\u201d on f. 117r, \u201c15\u201d on f. 125r, \u201c16\u201d on f. 133r, \u201c17\u201d on f. 141r, \u201c18\u201d on f. 149r, \u201c19\u201d on f. 157r, \u201c20\u201d on f. 163r, \u201c21\u201d on f. 171r, \u201c22\u201d on f. 181r).<br/>\nThe leaves are ruled in faint plummet, with six systems per folio side of 4-line inked staves with F- and C-clefs. The notation is Hufnagelschrift. The black/brown text script is in a Gothic liturgical hand, and the library catalogue identifies three main scribes (changing after ff. 116 and 162, corresponding with changes of runs of signatures). Ff. 091v-092r appear to be in a slightly later hand with a different ink (now flaking off). Throughout the manuscript, rubrics are in red, and some liturgical directions are underlined in red. There are approximately 290 calligraphic initials in black, touched in red, infilled with black penwork (to f. 116 only) of which nearly fifty include human faces or profiles, mostly of monks or of grotesque unshaven figures spitting. Approximately 316 large initials are painted in red or occasionally in blue. Three large initials (c. 50 x 60 mm) are elaborately drawn in blue with penwork infilling and full-length marginal flourishing in red partly infilled with a green wash; these mark the beginning of the Sanctorale (f. 001r), Common of the Saints (f. 092v) and Temporale f. 117r). On f. 001r and 092v the border terminates in a bushy-tailed dragon. Space for a fourth large initial for Pentecost (f. 136r) was left blank.",

Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

        "source_description": "Spanish-language inscriptions and annotations suggest this antiphoner\u2019s origin and use in Spain, although no date or place of origin or use is recorded or known. Prior to arrival at the University of Sydney library in 2017, its most recent ownership was in northern Europe. \n \nThe volume has been part of a set, as indicated by the Spanish inscription on the inside front cover: \u201cTiene los Reyes y las os Libro .3. Bisperas\u201d (It has the Kings [Epiphany] and the Os [O antiphons] Book 3 Vespers). The book\u2019s presentation suggests its design to follow immediately from the previous book in the set. \n\nThe binding appears original, and the book is complete apart from the loss of one folio. Arabic numerals are employed for the foliation and are placed top right recto of each folio. This appears to be the original foliation. Gathering numbers remain visible at bottom right corner of many folios. Initials indicate hierarchy of chants with the two most important categories employing both red and blue ink; black initials often with yellow highlighting are also used. The book shows signs of use and wear, and folios have been repaired sometimes with the addition of patches taken from other manuscript pages (including some showing more modern musical notation).\n \nOn the middle of the verso side of the book\u2019s final folio is a blank patch. Hidden beneath this pasted paper attachment is a colophon written in Spanish and probably dating from the time of copying of the book. The text refers to the involvement of two women in the book\u2019s preparation. They, along with the unnamed scribe, ask to be remembered by the users of the book in their prayers.\n\nInventory and description by Kathleen Nelson, The University of Sydney. \nCompleted September 2019.",

A colophon at 148r (fragmented) suggests that part of the manuscript may have been completed in 1600, as the fragmented date ends with a partially visible D followed by C.\n\nThe manuscript includes chants for the Proper of the Time (Palm Sunday to Eve of Pentecost) as well as Masses and interpolated Offices for the Proper of the Time and Proper of the Saints, ending with an isolated sequence and invitatory. Of the 148 folios, ff. 1r\u2013115v have Arabic foliation with red ink, whereas the latter folios have later added Roman foliation in black ink (ff. Ir\u2013XXXIIIv). The index continues the Arabic numbering from 116r\u2013148v rather than switching to the Roman foliation, but the Roman numbering is included in the Extra Field (any Roman numbering that is difficult to discern is indicated in square brackets, as in [1]). There is evidence of a different copyist\u2019s hand on ff. 146v\u2013148v for the sequence 'Victimae paschali laudes' and the invitatory for the Transfiguration, 'Summum regem gloriae' (fragmented). There are three lacunae: at 114v within Vigilia Pentecostes; 115r at the end of Vigilia Pentecostes and before a brief section of Mass Ordinary chants (Credo, Kyrie); and at 145v with a missing Magnificat antiphon for the feast of Joachim and before the concluding folios in a different hand.  The index includes manuscript abbreviations in the Manuscript Spellings Text Field. Abbreviated letters are indicated using a circumflex (ex: \u00ea). A such, the circumflex indicates the presence of an abbreviation, but not the specific abbreviatory mark. Consultation with the manuscript images can confirm which abbreviatory mark was employed by the scribe. The differentiae for the introit verses and antiphons are identified by differentia final and a sequentially-ordered numeral (ex: E1, E2). Variant versions of differentiae receive a letter suffix (ex: E1a, E2a). There is one fully notated invitatory tone: PA at 128v for Exspectationis BMV (an incipit only version occurs at 122v for Exaltatio Crucis).\n\nThis fragmented Gradual is part of a collection of thirty-eight liturgical manuscripts within the collection of the Church of San Francisco in Quito, including fifteen antiphonaries, four graduals, eight hymnals, ten psalters, and one ritual (see Estevez Monagas, 2019). Although much work has been done to address church music in Quito (including by American musicologist Robert M. Stevenson and Spanish musicologist Alejandro Mass\u00f3), the plainchant manuscripts of Quito are an emerging area of research, with the index for EC-Qsf 18P16 being the first published inventory of a plainchant volume from an Ecuadorian church.

Hildegardis (ff. 1\u2013121v); Liber Viarum Dei S. Elisabeth de Schoenau (ff. 121\u2013152v); Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (ff. 153\u2013170v); and an untitled dialogue between a priest and the devil (ff. 170\u2013173v). Only the portion of the codex with music, known as Symphonia Harmoniae Caelestium Revelationum (Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations), is inventoried in the Cantus Database.\n\nHildegard composed musical works for use in the Mass and Office c. 1141\u20131158, including antiphons, responses, sequences, hymns, a Kyrie, and an alleluia, which survive mainly in two extant sources, the Dendermonde and Wiesbaden codices.\n\nThe Dendermonde codex was completed before Nov. 1, 1176 in the scriptorium of the Rupertsberg cloister and sent to the Cistercian abbey of Villers in Brabant, Belgium as indicated by the owner\u2019s mark on f. 173v, \u201cLiber s[an]c[t]e Ma[rie de] Villari\u201d (The Benedictine Abbey of Villers). The codex was transferred to the abbey of Affligem in the seventeenth century, at which point \u201cMonasterii Haffligemensis\u201d was marked on f. 1. In 1796, the monks were expelled from Affligem due to the French Revolution, and in 1837, the abbey moved to Dendermonde. Since then, the manuscript has been held by the St. Pieters & Paulusabdij abbey. The codex was rebound in the eighteenth century with white paper flyleaves and \u201cM.S. OPERA HILDEGARDI [sic] VIRGINS\u201d was stamped on its spine. There are also pencil folio numbers in the upper right hand corners in a modern hand.\n\nThe differentiae in this manuscript are labelled according to their modal type: protus (1 or 2); deuterus (3 or 4); tritus (5 or 6); and tetrardus (7 or 8). Within each modal type, unique differentiae are identified by an uppercase letter indicating the final pitch of the differentia and an arbitrarily-assigned number, e.g. A1, D2, etc. The Volpiano transcription of each differentia is included in the Extra field.",

Of particular note is the inclusion of the office for Adalbert of Prague, Bishop and Martyr (celebrated April 23), also known as the office Ad festa pretiosi. As Jakub Kubieniec writes in his article on the office (see Bibliography), it appears in several manuscripts from Aachen beginning in the twelfth century, as well as in manuscripts from Krak\u00f3w. Kubieniec challenges an earlier theory that the office originated in Krak\u00f3w, as evidenced from an antiphoner from the Krak\u00f3w Cathedral (c. 1320, MS. 52), and argues that the Aachen antiphoner contains an earlier version of the office.</br></br>\nThe text of the manuscript is Roman miniscule and Gothic text in black ink, with early and high Gothic initials in blue and red ink with filigree, and plant and animal motifs (e.g., ff. 59v, 44v, 27r). Additions to the manuscript were made in the thirteenth to fifteenth century in various hands (f. 364r-406v).</br></br>\nDifferentiae are indexed by their last note and an arbitrarily assigned number.

        "source_description": "At Bellelay Abbey from as early as 1160 until the suppression of the Abbey in 1797, the Bellelay Gradual has unknown origins. Although an important Premonstratensian manuscript of the Jurassian region, it is likely that the manuscript originated from north-eastern France and was a gift to Bellelay Abbey at its founding. To that effect, the Messine notation is not typical of the Jurassian region, and the manuscript includes many erasures and corrections suggesting adaptation to local practice. Furthermore, only one saint in the Sanctorale is particular to the Jurassian region, St. Imer (Imier), and even this seems to be a later addition from the beginning of the 13th century. The manuscript may have been a gift from the mother house of Lac de Joux Abbey, itself a sister abbey to Saint-Martin de Laon in north-eastern France. ",
