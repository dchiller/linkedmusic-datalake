Therefore if thou art moved thou runn'st\naway.\n\nSAMPSON  A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I\nwill take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.\n\nGREGORY  That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest\ngoes to the wall.\n\nSAMPSON  'Tis true, and therefore women, being the\nweaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore\nI will push Montague's men from the wall and\nthrust his maids to the wall.\n\nGREGORY  The quarrel is between our masters and us\ntheir men.\n\nSAMPSON  'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant.\nWhen I have fought with the men, I will be civil\nwith the maids; I will cut off their heads.\n\nGREGORY  The heads of the maids?\n\nSAMPSON  Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.\nTake it in what sense thou wilt.\n\nGREGORY  They must take it in sense that feel it.\n\nSAMPSON  Me they shall feel while I am able to stand,\nand 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.\n\nGREGORY  'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou\nhadst been poor-john. Draw thy tool. Here comes\nof the house of Montagues.\n\n[Enter Abram with another Servingman.\n]\n\n\nSAMPSON  My naked weapon is out. Quarrel, I will back\nthee.\n\nGREGORY  How? Turn thy back and run?\n\nSAMPSON  Fear me not.\n\nGREGORY  No, marry. I fear thee!\n\nSAMPSON  Let us take the law of our sides; let them\nbegin.\n\nGREGORY  I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it\nas they list.\n\nSAMPSON  Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at\nthem, which is disgrace to them if they bear it.\n[He bites his thumb.\n]\n\nABRAM  Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?\n\nSAMPSON  I do bite my thumb, sir.\n\nABRAM  Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?\n\nSAMPSON,\n[aside to Gregory\n]  Is the law of our side if I\nsay \"Ay\"?\n\nGREGORY,\n[aside to Sampson\n]  No.\n\nSAMPSON  No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir,\nbut I bite my thumb, sir.\n\nGREGORY  Do you quarrel, sir?\n\nABRAM  Quarrel, sir? No, sir.\n\nSAMPSON  But if you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as\ngood a man as you.\n\nABRAM  No better.\n\nSAMPSON  Well, sir.\n\n[Enter Benvolio.\n]\n\n\nGREGORY,\n[aside to Sampson\n]  Say \"better\"; here comes\none of my master's kinsmen.\n\nSAMPSON  Yes, better, sir.\n\nABRAM  You lie.\n\nSAMPSON  Draw if you be men.--Gregory, remember\nthy washing blow.\t[They fight.\n]\n\nBENVOLIO  Part, fools!\t[Drawing his sword.\n]\nPut up your swords. You know not what you do.\n\n[Enter Tybalt, drawing his sword.\n]\n\n\nTYBALT\nWhat, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?\nTurn thee, Benvolio; look upon thy death.\n\nBENVOLIO\nI do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,\nOr manage it to part these men with me.\n\nTYBALT\nWhat, drawn and talk of peace? I hate the word\nAs I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.\nHave at thee, coward!\t[They fight.\n]\n\n[Enter three or four Citizens with clubs or partisans.\n]\n\n\nCITIZENS\nClubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! Beat them down!\nDown with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!\n\n[Enter old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife.\n]\n\n\nCAPULET\nWhat noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!\n\nLADY CAPULET\nA crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a\nsword?\n\n[Enter old Montague and his Wife.\n]\n\nCAPULET\nMy sword, I say. Old Montague is come\nAnd flourishes his blade in spite of me.\n\nMONTAGUE\nThou villain Capulet!--Hold me not; let me go.\n\nLADY MONTAGUE\nThou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.\n\n[Enter Prince Escalus with his train.\n]\n\n\nPRINCE\nRebellious subjects, enemies to peace,\nProfaners of this neighbor-stained steel--\nWill they not hear?--What ho! You men, you beasts,\nThat quench the fire of your pernicious rage\nWith purple fountains issuing from your veins:\nOn pain of torture, from those bloody hands\nThrow your mistempered weapons to the ground,\nAnd hear the sentence of your moved prince.\nThree civil brawls bred of an airy word\nBy thee, old Capulet, and Montague,\nHave thrice disturbed the quiet of our streets\nAnd made Verona's ancient citizens\nCast by their grave-beseeming ornaments\nTo wield old partisans in hands as old,\nCankered with peace, to part your cankered hate.\nIf ever you disturb our streets again,\nYour lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.\nFor this time all the rest depart away.\nYou, Capulet, shall go along with me,\nAnd, Montague, come you this afternoon\nTo know our farther pleasure in this case,\nTo old Free-town, our common judgment-place.\nOnce more, on pain of death, all men depart.\n[All but Montague, Lady Montague,\nand Benvolio exit.\n]\n\nMONTAGUE,\n[to Benvolio\n]\nWho set this ancient quarrel new abroach?\nSpeak, nephew, were you by when it began?\n\nBENVOLIO\nHere were the servants of your adversary,\nAnd yours, close fighting ere I did approach.\nI drew to part them. In the instant came\nThe fiery Tybalt with his sword prepared,\nWhich, as he breathed defiance to my ears,\nHe swung about his head and cut the winds,\nWho, nothing hurt withal, hissed him in scorn.\nWhile we were interchanging thrusts and blows\nCame more and more and fought on part and part,\nTill the Prince came, who parted either part.\n\nLADY MONTAGUE\nO, where is Romeo? Saw you him today?\nRight glad I am he was not at this fray.\n\nBENVOLIO\nMadam, an hour before the worshiped sun\nPeered forth the golden window of the east,\nA troubled mind drove me to walk abroad,\nWhere underneath the grove of sycamore\nThat westward rooteth from this city side,\nSo early walking did I see your son.\nTowards him I made, but he was 'ware of me\nAnd stole into the covert of the wood.\nI, measuring his affections by my own\n(Which then most sought where most might not be\nfound,\nBeing one too many by my weary self),\nPursued my humor, not pursuing his,\nAnd gladly shunned who gladly fled from me.\n\nMONTAGUE\nMany a morning hath he there been seen,\nWith tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,\nAdding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.\nBut all so soon as the all-cheering sun\nShould in the farthest east begin to draw\nThe shady curtains from Aurora's bed,\nAway from light steals home my heavy son\nAnd private in his chamber pens himself,\nShuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,\nAnd makes himself an artificial night.\nBlack and portentous must this humor prove,\nUnless good counsel may the cause remove.\n\nBENVOLIO\nMy noble uncle, do you know the cause?\n\nMONTAGUE\nI neither know it nor can learn of him.\n\nBENVOLIO\nHave you importuned him by any means?\n\nMONTAGUE\nBoth by myself and many other friends.\nBut he, his own affections' counselor,\nIs to himself--I will not say how true,\nBut to himself so secret and so close,\nSo far from sounding and discovery,\nAs is the bud bit with an envious worm\nEre he can spread his sweet leaves to the air\nOr dedicate his beauty to the same.\nCould we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,\nWe would as willingly give cure as know.\n\n[Enter Romeo.\n]\n\n\nBENVOLIO\nSee where he comes. So please you, step aside.\nI'll know his grievance or be much denied.\n\nMONTAGUE\nI would thou wert so happy by thy stay\nTo hear true shrift.--Come, madam, let's away.\n[Montague and Lady Montague exit.\n]\n\nBENVOLIO\nGood morrow, cousin.\n\nROMEO  Is the day so young?\n\nBENVOLIO\nBut new struck nine.\n\nROMEO  Ay me, sad hours seem long.\nWas that my father that went hence so fast?\n\nBENVOLIO\nIt was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?\n\nROMEO\nNot having that which, having, makes them short.\n\nBENVOLIO  In love?\n\nROMEO  Out--\n\nBENVOLIO  Of love?\n\nROMEO\nOut of her favor where I am in love.\n\nBENVOLIO\nAlas that love, so gentle in his view,\nShould be so tyrannous and rough in proof!\n\nROMEO\nAlas that love, whose view is muffled still,\nShould without eyes see pathways to his will!\nWhere shall we dine?--O me! What fray was here?\nYet tell me not, for I have heard it all.\nHere's much to do with hate, but more with love.\nWhy then, O brawling love, O loving hate,\nO anything of nothing first create!\nO heavy lightness, serious vanity,\nMisshapen chaos of well-seeming forms,\nFeather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,\nStill-waking sleep that is not what it is!\nThis love feel I, that feel no love in this.\nDost thou not laugh?\n\nBENVOLIO  No, coz, I rather weep.\n\nROMEO\nGood heart, at what?\n\nBENVOLIO  At thy good heart's oppression.\n\nROMEO  Why, such is love's transgression.\nGriefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,\nWhich thou wilt propagate to have it pressed\nWith more of thine. This love that thou hast shown\nDoth add more grief to too much of mine own.\nLove is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;\nBeing purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;\nBeing vexed, a sea nourished with loving tears.\nWhat is it else? A madness most discreet,\nA choking gall, and a preserving sweet.\nFarewell, my coz.\n\nBENVOLIO  Soft, I will go along.\nAn if you leave me so, you do me wrong.\n\nROMEO\nTut, I have lost myself. I am not here.\nThis is not Romeo. He's some other where.\n\nBENVOLIO\nTell me in sadness, who is that you love?\n\nROMEO  What, shall I groan and tell thee?\n\nBENVOLIO\nGroan? Why, no. But sadly tell me who.\n\nROMEO\nA sick man in sadness makes his will--\nA word ill urged to one that is so ill.\nIn sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.\n\nBENVOLIO\nI aimed so near when I supposed you loved.\n\nROMEO\nA right good markman! And she's fair I love.\n\nBENVOLIO\nA right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.\n\nROMEO\nWell in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit\nWith Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit,\nAnd, in strong proof of chastity well armed,\nFrom love's weak childish bow she lives uncharmed.\nShe will not stay the siege of loving terms,\nNor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,\nNor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.\nO, she is rich in beauty, only poor\nThat, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.\n\nBENVOLIO\nThen she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?\n\nROMEO\nShe hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;\nFor beauty, starved with her severity,\nCuts beauty off from all posterity.\nShe is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,\nTo merit bliss by making me despair.\nShe hath forsworn to love, and in that vow\nDo I live dead, that live to tell it now.\n\nBENVOLIO\nBe ruled by me. Forget to think of her.\n\nROMEO\nO, teach me how I should forget to think!\n\nBENVOLIO\nBy giving liberty unto thine eyes.\nExamine other beauties.\n\nROMEO  'Tis the way\nTo call hers, exquisite, in question more.\nThese happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,\nBeing black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.\nHe that is strucken blind cannot forget\nThe precious treasure of his eyesight lost.\nShow me a mistress that is passing fair;\nWhat doth her beauty serve but as a note\nWhere I may read who passed that passing fair?\nFarewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.\n\nBENVOLIO\nI'll pay that doctrine or else die in debt.\n[They exit.\n]\n\nScene 2\n=======\n[Enter Capulet, County Paris, and a Servingman.\n]\n\n\nCAPULET\nBut Montague is bound as well as I,\nIn penalty alike, and 'tis not hard, I think,\nFor men so old as we to keep the peace.\n\nPARIS\nOf honorable reckoning are you both,\nAnd pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.\nBut now, my lord, what say you to my suit?\n\nCAPULET\nBut saying o'er what I have said before.\nMy child is yet a stranger in the world.\nShe hath not seen the change of fourteen years.\nLet two more summers wither in their pride\nEre we may think her ripe to be a bride.\n\nPARIS\nYounger than she are happy mothers made.\n\nCAPULET\nAnd too soon marred are those so early made.\nEarth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;\nShe's the hopeful lady of my earth.\nBut woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;\nMy will to her consent is but a part.\nAnd, she agreed, within her scope of choice\nLies my consent and fair according voice.\nThis night I hold an old accustomed feast,\nWhereto I have invited many a guest\nSuch as I love; and you among the store,\nOne more, most welcome, makes my number more.\nAt my poor house look to behold this night\nEarth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.\nSuch comfort as do lusty young men feel\nWhen well-appareled April on the heel\nOf limping winter treads, even such delight\nAmong fresh fennel buds shall you this night\nInherit at my house. Hear all, all see,\nAnd like her most whose merit most shall be;\nWhich, on more view of many, mine, being one,\nMay stand in number, though in reck'ning none.\nCome go with me.\t[To Servingman, giving him a list.\n]\nGo, sirrah, trudge about\nThrough fair Verona, find those persons out\nWhose names are written there, and to them say\nMy house and welcome on their pleasure stay.\n[Capulet and Paris exit.\n]\n\nSERVINGMAN  Find them out whose names are written\nhere! It is written that the shoemaker should\nmeddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the\nfisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets.\nBut I am sent to find those persons whose names\nare here writ, and can never find what names the\nwriting person hath here writ. I must to the learned.\nIn good time!\n\n[Enter Benvolio and Romeo.\n]\n\n\nBENVOLIO,\n[to Romeo\n]\nTut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;\nOne pain is lessened by another's anguish.\nTurn giddy, and be helped by backward turning.\nOne desperate grief cures with another's languish.\nTake thou some new infection to thy eye,\nAnd the rank poison of the old will die.\n\nROMEO\nYour plantain leaf is excellent for that.\n\nBENVOLIO\nFor what, I pray thee?\n\nROMEO  For your broken shin.\n\nBENVOLIO  Why Romeo, art thou mad?\n\nROMEO\nNot mad, but bound more than a madman is,\nShut up in prison, kept without my food,\nWhipped and tormented, and--good e'en, good\nfellow.\n\nSERVINGMAN  God gi' good e'en. I pray, sir, can you\nread?\n\nROMEO\nAy, mine own fortune in my misery.\n\nSERVINGMAN  Perhaps you have learned it without\nbook. But I pray, can you read anything you see?\n\nROMEO\nAy, if I know the letters and the language.\n\nSERVINGMAN  You say honestly. Rest you merry.\n\nROMEO  Stay, fellow. I can read.\t[(He reads the letter.)\n]\nSignior Martino and his wife and daughters,\nCounty Anselme and his beauteous sisters,\nThe lady widow of Vitruvio,\nSignior Placentio and his lovely nieces,\nMercutio and his brother Valentine,\nMine Uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters,\nMy fair niece Rosaline and Livia,\nSignior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt,\nLucio and the lively Helena.\nA fair assembly. Whither should they come?\n\nSERVINGMAN  Up.\n\nROMEO  Whither? To supper?\n\nSERVINGMAN  To our house.\n\nROMEO  Whose house?\n\nSERVINGMAN  My master's.\n\nROMEO\nIndeed I should have asked thee that before.\n\nSERVINGMAN  Now I'll tell you without asking. My\nmaster is the great rich Capulet, and, if you be not\nof the house of Montagues, I pray come and crush a\ncup of wine. Rest you merry.\t[He exits.\n]\n\nBENVOLIO\nAt this same ancient feast of Capulet's\nSups the fair Rosaline whom thou so loves,\nWith all the admired beauties of Verona.\nGo thither, and with unattainted eye\nCompare her face with some that I shall show,\nAnd I will make thee think thy swan a crow.\n\nROMEO\nWhen the devout religion of mine eye\nMaintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fire;\nAnd these who, often drowned, could never die,\nTransparent heretics, be burnt for liars.\nOne fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun\nNe'er saw her match since first the world begun.\n\nBENVOLIO\nTut, you saw her fair, none else being by,\nHerself poised with herself in either eye;\nBut in that crystal scales let there be weighed\nYour lady's love against some other maid\nThat I will show you shining at this feast,\nAnd she shall scant show well that now seems best.\n\nROMEO\nI'll go along, no such sight to be shown,\nBut to rejoice in splendor of mine own.\n[They exit.\n]\n\nScene 3\n=======\n[Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse.\n]\n\n\nLADY CAPULET\nNurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me.\n\nNURSE\nNow, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,\nI bade her come.--What, lamb! What, ladybird!\nGod forbid. Where's this girl? What, Juliet!\n\n[Enter Juliet.\n]\n\n\nJULIET  How now, who calls?\n\nNURSE  Your mother.\n\nJULIET\nMadam, I am here. What is your will?\n\nLADY CAPULET\nThis is the matter.--Nurse, give leave awhile.\nWe must talk in secret.--Nurse, come back again.\nI have remembered me, thou 's hear our counsel.\nThou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.\n\nNURSE\nFaith, I can tell her age unto an hour.\n\nLADY CAPULET  She's not fourteen.\n\nNURSE  I'll lay fourteen of my teeth (and yet, to my teen\nbe it spoken, I have but four) she's not fourteen.\nHow long is it now to Lammastide?\n\nLADY CAPULET  A fortnight and odd days.\n\nNURSE\nEven or odd, of all days in the year,\nCome Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.\nSusan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)\nWere of an age. Well, Susan is with God;\nShe was too good for me. But, as I said,\nOn Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.\nThat shall she. Marry, I remember it well.\n'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years,\nAnd she was weaned (I never shall forget it)\nOf all the days of the year, upon that day.\nFor I had then laid wormwood to my dug,\nSitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.\nMy lord and you were then at Mantua.\nNay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,\nWhen it did taste the wormwood on the nipple\nOf my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,\nTo see it tetchy and fall out with the dug.\n\"Shake,\" quoth the dovehouse. 'Twas no need, I\ntrow,\nTo bid me trudge.\nAnd since that time it is eleven years.\nFor then she could stand high-lone. Nay, by th'\nrood,\nShe could have run and waddled all about,\nFor even the day before, she broke her brow,\nAnd then my husband (God be with his soul,\nHe was a merry man) took up the child.\n\"Yea,\" quoth he, \"Dost thou fall upon thy face?\nThou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit,\nWilt thou not, Jule?\" And, by my holidam,\nThe pretty wretch left crying and said \"Ay.\"\nTo see now how a jest shall come about!\nI warrant, an I should live a thousand years,\nI never should forget it. \"Wilt thou not, Jule?\"\nquoth he.\nAnd, pretty fool, it stinted and said \"Ay.\"\n\nLADY CAPULET\nEnough of this. I pray thee, hold thy peace.\n\nNURSE\nYes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh\nTo think it should leave crying and say \"Ay.\"\nAnd yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow\nA bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone,\nA perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.\n\"Yea,\" quoth my husband. \"Fall'st upon thy face?\nThou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age,\nWilt thou not, Jule?\" It stinted and said \"Ay.\"\n\nJULIET\nAnd stint thou, too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.\n\nNURSE\nPeace. I have done. God mark thee to his grace,\nThou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.\nAn I might live to see thee married once,\nI have my wish.\n\nLADY CAPULET\nMarry, that \"marry\" is the very theme\nI came to talk of.--Tell me, daughter Juliet,\nHow stands your disposition to be married?\n\nJULIET\nIt is an honor that I dream not of.\n\nNURSE\nAn honor? Were not I thine only nurse,\nI would say thou hadst sucked wisdom from thy\nteat.\n\nLADY CAPULET\nWell, think of marriage now. Younger than you\nHere in Verona, ladies of esteem,\nAre made already mothers. By my count\nI was your mother much upon these years\nThat you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief:\nThe valiant Paris seeks you for his love.\n\nNURSE\nA man, young lady--lady, such a man\nAs all the world--why, he's a man of wax.\n\nLADY CAPULET\nVerona's summer hath not such a flower.\n\nNURSE\nNay, he's a flower, in faith, a very flower.\n\nLADY CAPULET\nWhat say you? Can you love the gentleman?\nThis night you shall behold him at our feast.\nRead o'er the volume of young Paris' face,\nAnd find delight writ there with beauty's pen.\nExamine every married lineament\nAnd see how one another lends content,\nAnd what obscured in this fair volume lies\nFind written in the margent of his eyes.\nThis precious book of love, this unbound lover,\nTo beautify him only lacks a cover.\nThe fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride\nFor fair without the fair within to hide.\nThat book in many's eyes doth share the glory\nThat in gold clasps locks in the golden story.\nSo shall you share all that he doth possess\nBy having him, making yourself no less.\n\nNURSE\nNo less? Nay, bigger. Women grow by men.\n\nLADY CAPULET\nSpeak briefly. Can you like of Paris' love?\n\nJULIET\nI'll look to like, if looking liking move.\nBut no more deep will I endart mine eye\nThan your consent gives strength to make it fly.\n\n[Enter Servingman.\n]\n\n\nSERVINGMAN  Madam, the guests are come, supper\nserved up, you called, my young lady asked for, the\nNurse cursed in the pantry, and everything in\nextremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you,\nfollow straight.\n\nLADY CAPULET\nWe follow thee.\t[Servingman exits.\n]\nJuliet, the County stays.\n\nNURSE\nGo, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.\n[They exit.\n]\n\nScene 4\n=======\n[Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other\nMaskers, Torchbearers, and a Boy with a drum.\n]\n\n\nROMEO\nWhat, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?\nOr shall we on without apology?\n\nBENVOLIO\nThe date is out of such prolixity.\nWe'll have no Cupid hoodwinked with a scarf,\nBearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,\nScaring the ladies like a crowkeeper,\nNor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke\nAfter the prompter, for our entrance.\nBut let them measure us by what they will.\nWe'll measure them a measure and be gone.\n\nROMEO\nGive me a torch. I am not for this ambling.\nBeing but heavy I will bear the light.\n\nMERCUTIO\nNay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.\n\nROMEO\nNot I, believe me. You have dancing shoes\nWith nimble soles. I have a soul of lead\nSo stakes me to the ground I cannot move.\n\nMERCUTIO\nYou are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings\nAnd soar with them above a common bound.\n\nROMEO\nI am too sore enpierced with his shaft\nTo soar with his light feathers, and so bound\nI cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.\nUnder love's heavy burden do I sink.\n\nMERCUTIO\nAnd to sink in it should you burden love--\nToo great oppression for a tender thing.\n\nROMEO\nIs love a tender thing? It is too rough,\nToo rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.\n\nMERCUTIO\nIf love be rough with you, be rough with love.\nPrick love for pricking, and you beat love down.--\nGive me a case to put my visage in.--\nA visor for a visor.

Pronounce this sentence\nthen:\nWomen may fall when there's no strength in men.\n\nROMEO\nThou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nFor doting, not for loving, pupil mine.\n\nROMEO\nAnd bad'st me bury love.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE  Not in a grave\nTo lay one in, another out to have.\n\nROMEO\nI pray thee, chide me not. Her I love now\nDoth grace for grace and love for love allow.\nThe other did not so.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE  O, she knew well\nThy love did read by rote, that could not spell.\nBut come, young waverer, come, go with me.\nIn one respect I'll thy assistant be,\nFor this alliance may so happy prove\nTo turn your households' rancor to pure love.\n\nROMEO\nO, let us hence. I stand on sudden haste.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nWisely and slow.

I spoke with his man.\n\nMERCUTIO\nWhy, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that\nRosaline,\nTorments him so that he will sure run mad.\n\nBENVOLIO\nTybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,\nHath sent a letter to his father's house.\n\nMERCUTIO  A challenge, on my life.\n\nBENVOLIO  Romeo will answer it.\n\nMERCUTIO  Any man that can write may answer a letter.\n\nBENVOLIO  Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how\nhe dares, being dared.\n\nMERCUTIO  Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead,\nstabbed with a white wench's black eye, run\nthrough the ear with a love-song, the very pin of his\nheart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt shaft. And\nis he a man to encounter Tybalt?\n\nBENVOLIO  Why, what is Tybalt?\n\nMERCUTIO  More than prince of cats. O, he's the courageous\ncaptain of compliments. He fights as you sing\nprick-song, keeps time, distance, and proportion.\nHe rests his minim rests, one, two, and the third in\nyour bosom--the very butcher of a silk button, a\nduelist, a duelist, a gentleman of the very first house\nof the first and second cause. Ah, the immortal\npassado, the punto reverso, the hay!\n\nBENVOLIO  The what?\n\nMERCUTIO  The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting\nphantasimes, these new tuners of accent: \"By\nJesu, a very good blade! A very tall man! A very good\nwhore!\" Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire,\nthat we should be thus afflicted with these\nstrange flies, these fashion-mongers, these \"pardon-me\" 's,\nwho stand so much on the new form\nthat they cannot sit at ease on the old bench? O their\nbones, their bones!\n\n[Enter Romeo.\n]\n\n\nBENVOLIO  Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.\n\nMERCUTIO  Without his roe, like a dried herring. O\nflesh, flesh, how art thou fishified! Now is he for the\nnumbers that Petrarch flowed in. Laura to his lady\nwas a kitchen wench (marry, she had a better love\nto berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,\nHelen and Hero hildings and harlots, Thisbe a gray\neye or so, but not to the purpose.--Signior Romeo,\nbonjour. There's a French salutation to your French\nslop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.\n\nROMEO  Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit\ndid I give you?\n\nMERCUTIO  The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?\n\nROMEO  Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was\ngreat, and in such a case as mine a man may strain\ncourtesy.\n\nMERCUTIO  That's as much as to say such a case as\nyours constrains a man to bow in the hams.\n\nROMEO  Meaning, to curtsy.\n\nMERCUTIO  Thou hast most kindly hit it.\n\nROMEO  A most courteous exposition.\n\nMERCUTIO  Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.\n\nROMEO  \"Pink\" for flower.\n\nMERCUTIO  Right.\n\nROMEO  Why, then is my pump well flowered.\n\nMERCUTIO  Sure wit, follow me this jest now till thou\nhast worn out thy pump, that when the single sole\nof it is worn, the jest may remain, after the wearing,\nsolely singular.\n\nROMEO  O single-soled jest, solely singular for the\nsingleness.\n\nMERCUTIO  Come between us, good Benvolio. My wits\nfaints.\n\nROMEO  Switch and spurs, switch and spurs, or I'll cry\na match.\n\nMERCUTIO  Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I\nam done, for thou hast more of the wild goose in\none of thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole\nfive. Was I with you there for the goose?\n\nROMEO  Thou wast never with me for anything when\nthou wast not there for the goose.\n\nMERCUTIO  I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.\n\nROMEO  Nay, good goose, bite not.\n\nMERCUTIO  Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most\nsharp sauce.\n\nROMEO  And is it not, then, well served into a sweet\ngoose?\n\nMERCUTIO  O, here's a wit of cheveril that stretches\nfrom an inch narrow to an ell broad.\n\nROMEO  I stretch it out for that word \"broad,\" which\nadded to the goose, proves thee far and wide a\nbroad goose.\n\nMERCUTIO  Why, is not this better now than groaning\nfor love? Now art thou sociable, now art thou\nRomeo, now art thou what thou art, by art as well as\nby nature. For this driveling love is like a great\nnatural that runs lolling up and down to hide his\nbauble in a hole.\n\nBENVOLIO  Stop there, stop there.\n\nMERCUTIO  Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against\nthe hair.\n\nBENVOLIO  Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.\n\nMERCUTIO  O, thou art deceived. I would have made it\nshort, for I was come to the whole depth of my tale\nand meant indeed to occupy the argument no\nlonger.\n\n[Enter Nurse and her man Peter.\n]\n\n\nROMEO  Here's goodly gear.

What a man are you?\n\nROMEO  One, gentlewoman, that God hath made, himself\nto mar.\n\nNURSE  By my troth, it is well said: \"for himself to\nmar,\" quoth he? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me\nwhere I may find the young Romeo?\n\nROMEO  I can tell you, but young Romeo will be older\nwhen you have found him than he was when you\nsought him. I am the youngest of that name, for\nfault of a worse.\n\nNURSE  You say well.\n\nMERCUTIO  Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i'\nfaith, wisely, wisely.\n\nNURSE  If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with\nyou.\n\nBENVOLIO  She will indite him to some supper.\n\nMERCUTIO  A bawd, a bawd, a bawd. So ho!\n\nROMEO  What hast thou found?\n\nMERCUTIO  No hare, sir, unless a hare, sir, in a Lenten\npie that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.\n[Singing.\n]\tAn old hare hoar,\n\tAnd an old hare hoar,\n\t   Is very good meat in Lent.\n\tBut a hare that is hoar\n\tIs too much for a score\n\t   When it hoars ere it be spent.\nRomeo, will you come to your father's?

An if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.\nScurvy knave, I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none\nof his skains-mates. [To Peter.\n] And thou must stand\nby too and suffer every knave to use me at his\npleasure.\n\nPETER  I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had,\nmy weapon should quickly have been out. I warrant\nyou, I dare draw as soon as another man, if I\nsee occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my\nside.\n\nNURSE  Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part\nabout me quivers. Scurvy knave! [To Romeo.\n] Pray\nyou, sir, a word. And, as I told you, my young lady\nbid me inquire you out. What she bid me say, I will\nkeep to myself. But first let me tell you, if you\nshould lead her in a fool's paradise, as they say, it\nwere a very gross kind of behavior, as they say. For\nthe gentlewoman is young; and therefore, if you\nshould deal double with her, truly it were an ill\nthing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and very\nweak dealing.\n\nROMEO  Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress.\nI protest unto thee--\n\nNURSE  Good heart, and i' faith I will tell her as much.\nLord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.\n\nROMEO  What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not\nmark me.\n\nNURSE  I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as\nI take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.\n\nROMEO  Bid her devise\nSome means to come to shrift this afternoon,\nAnd there she shall at Friar Lawrence' cell\nBe shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.\n[Offering her money.\n]\n\nNURSE  No, truly, sir, not a penny.\n\nROMEO  Go to, I say you shall.\n\nNURSE\nThis afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.\n\nROMEO\nAnd stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.\nWithin this hour my man shall be with thee\nAnd bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,\nWhich to the high topgallant of my joy\nMust be my convoy in the secret night.\nFarewell. Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.\nFarewell. Commend me to thy mistress.\n\nNURSE\nNow, God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.\n\nROMEO  What sayst thou, my dear nurse?\n\nNURSE\nIs your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say\n\"Two may keep counsel, putting one away\"?\n\nROMEO\nWarrant thee, my man's as true as steel.\n\nNURSE  Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord,\nLord, when 'twas a little prating thing--O, there is\na nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain lay\nknife aboard, but she, good soul, had as lief see a\ntoad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes\nand tell her that Paris is the properer man, but I'll\nwarrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any\nclout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and\nRomeo begin both with a letter?\n\nROMEO  Ay, nurse, what of that? Both with an R.\n\nNURSE  Ah, mocker, that's the dog's name. R is for\nthe--No, I know it begins with some other letter,\nand she hath the prettiest sententious of it, of you\nand rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.\n\nROMEO  Commend me to thy lady.\n\nNURSE  Ay, a thousand times.--Peter.\n\nPETER  Anon.\n\nNURSE  Before and apace.\n[They exit.\n]\n\nScene 5\n=======\n[Enter Juliet.\n]\n\n\nJULIET\nThe clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse.\nIn half an hour she promised to return.\nPerchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.\nO, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,\nWhich ten times faster glides than the sun's beams,\nDriving back shadows over louring hills.\nTherefore do nimble-pinioned doves draw Love,\nAnd therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.\nNow is the sun upon the highmost hill\nOf this day's journey, and from nine till twelve\nIs three long hours, yet she is not come.\nHad she affections and warm youthful blood,\nShe would be as swift in motion as a ball;\nMy words would bandy her to my sweet love,\nAnd his to me.\nBut old folks, many feign as they were dead,\nUnwieldy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead.\n\n[Enter Nurse and Peter.\n]\n\nO God, she comes!--O, honey nurse, what news?\nHast thou met with him? Send thy man away.\n\nNURSE  Peter, stay at the gate.\t[Peter exits.\n]\n\nJULIET\nNow, good sweet nurse--O Lord, why lookest thou\nsad?\nThough news be sad, yet tell them merrily.\nIf good, thou shamest the music of sweet news\nBy playing it to me with so sour a face.\n\nNURSE\nI am aweary. Give me leave awhile.\nFie, how my bones ache! What a jaunt have I!\n\nJULIET\nI would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.\nNay, come, I pray thee, speak. Good, good nurse,\nspeak.\n\nNURSE\nJesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?\nDo you not see that I am out of breath?\n\nJULIET\nHow art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath\nTo say to me that thou art out of breath?\nThe excuse that thou dost make in this delay\nIs longer than the tale thou dost excuse.\nIs thy news good or bad? Answer to that.\nSay either, and I'll stay the circumstance.\nLet me be satisfied; is 't good or bad?\n\nNURSE  Well, you have made a simple choice. You know\nnot how to choose a man. Romeo? No, not he.\nThough his face be better than any man's, yet his leg\nexcels all men's, and for a hand and a foot and a\nbody, though they be not to be talked on, yet they\nare past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy,\nbut I'll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy\nways, wench. Serve God. What, have you dined at\nhome?\n\nJULIET\nNo, no. But all this did I know before.\nWhat says he of our marriage? What of that?\n\nNURSE\nLord, how my head aches! What a head have I!\nIt beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.\nMy back o' t' other side! Ah, my back, my back!\nBeshrew your heart for sending me about\nTo catch my death with jaunting up and down.\n\nJULIET\nI' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.\nSweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my\nlove?\n\nNURSE  Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a\ncourteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I\nwarrant, a virtuous--Where is your mother?\n\nJULIET\nWhere is my mother? Why, she is within.\nWhere should she be? How oddly thou repliest:\n\"Your love says, like an honest gentleman,\nWhere is your mother?\"\n\nNURSE  O God's lady dear,\nAre you so hot? Marry, come up, I trow.\nIs this the poultice for my aching bones?\nHenceforward do your messages yourself.\n\nJULIET\nHere's such a coil. Come, what says Romeo?\n\nNURSE\nHave you got leave to go to shrift today?\n\nJULIET  I have.\n\nNURSE\nThen hie you hence to Friar Lawrence' cell.\nThere stays a husband to make you a wife.\nNow comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks;\nThey'll be in scarlet straight at any news.\nHie you to church. I must another way,\nTo fetch a ladder by the which your love\nMust climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.\nI am the drudge and toil in your delight,\nBut you shall bear the burden soon at night.\nGo. I'll to dinner. Hie you to the cell.\n\nJULIET\nHie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.\n[They exit.\n]\n\nScene 6\n=======\n[Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo.\n]\n\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nSo smile the heavens upon this holy act\nThat after-hours with sorrow chide us not.\n\nROMEO\nAmen, amen. But come what sorrow can,\nIt cannot countervail the exchange of joy\nThat one short minute gives me in her sight.\nDo thou but close our hands with holy words,\nThen love-devouring death do what he dare,\nIt is enough I may but call her mine.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nThese violent delights have violent ends\nAnd in their triumph die, like fire and powder,\nWhich, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey\nIs loathsome in his own deliciousness\nAnd in the taste confounds the appetite.\nTherefore love moderately. Long love doth so.\nToo swift arrives as tardy as too slow.\n\n[Enter Juliet.\n]\n\nHere comes the lady. O, so light a foot\nWill ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.\nA lover may bestride the gossamers\nThat idles in the wanton summer air,\nAnd yet not fall, so light is vanity.\n\nJULIET\nGood even to my ghostly confessor.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nRomeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.\n\nJULIET\nAs much to him, else is his thanks too much.\n\nROMEO\nAh, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy\nBe heaped like mine, and that thy skill be more\nTo blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath\nThis neighbor air, and let rich music's tongue\nUnfold the imagined happiness that both\nReceive in either by this dear encounter.\n\nJULIET\nConceit, more rich in matter than in words,\nBrags of his substance, not of ornament.\nThey are but beggars that can count their worth,\nBut my true love is grown to such excess\nI cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nCome, come with me, and we will make short work,\nFor, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone\nTill Holy Church incorporate two in one.\n[They exit.\n]\n\n\nACT 3\n=====\n\nScene 1\n=======\n[Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, and their men.\n]\n\n\nBENVOLIO\nI pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.\nThe day is hot, the Capels are abroad,\nAnd if we meet we shall not 'scape a brawl,\nFor now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.\n\nMERCUTIO  Thou art like one of these fellows that, when\nhe enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his\nsword upon the table and says \"God send me no\nneed of thee\" and, by the operation of the second\ncup, draws him on the drawer when indeed there is\nno need.\n\nBENVOLIO  Am I like such a fellow?\n\nMERCUTIO  Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy\nmood as any in Italy, and as soon moved to be\nmoody, and as soon moody to be moved.\n\nBENVOLIO  And what to?\n\nMERCUTIO  Nay, an there were two such, we should\nhave none shortly, for one would kill the other.\nThou--why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that\nhath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than\nthou hast. Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking\nnuts, having no other reason but because thou\nhast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy\nout such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels as\nan egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been\nbeaten as addle as an egg for quarreling. Thou hast\nquarreled with a man for coughing in the street\nbecause he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain\nasleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a tailor\nfor wearing his new doublet before Easter? With\nanother, for tying his new shoes with old ribbon?\nAnd yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling?\n\nBENVOLIO  An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any\nman should buy the fee simple of my life for an\nhour and a quarter.\n\nMERCUTIO  The fee simple? O simple!\n\n[Enter Tybalt, Petruchio, and others.\n]\n\n\nBENVOLIO  By my head, here comes the Capulets.\n\nMERCUTIO  By my heel, I care not.\n\nTYBALT,\n[to his companions\n]\nFollow me close, for I will speak to them.--\nGentlemen, good e'en.

What, dost thou make us minstrels?\nAn thou make minstrels of us, look to hear\nnothing but discords. Here's my fiddlestick; here's\nthat shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!\n\nBENVOLIO\nWe talk here in the public haunt of men.\nEither withdraw unto some private place,\nOr reason coldly of your grievances,\nOr else depart.

Villain am I none.\nTherefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.\n\nTYBALT\nBoy, this shall not excuse the injuries\nThat thou hast done me. Therefore turn and draw.\n\nROMEO\nI do protest I never injured thee\nBut love thee better than thou canst devise\nTill thou shalt know the reason of my love.\nAnd so, good Capulet, which name I tender\nAs dearly as mine own, be satisfied.\n\nMERCUTIO\nO calm, dishonorable, vile submission!\nAlla stoccato carries it away.\t[He draws.\n]\nTybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?\n\nTYBALT  What wouldst thou have with me?\n\nMERCUTIO  Good king of cats, nothing but one of your\nnine lives, that I mean to make bold withal, and, as\nyou shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest of the\neight.

Friends, part!\" and swifter than his\ntongue\nHis agile arm beats down their fatal points,\nAnd 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm\nAn envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life\nOf stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.\nBut by and by comes back to Romeo,\nWho had but newly entertained revenge,\nAnd to 't they go like lightning, for ere I\nCould draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain,\nAnd, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.\nThis is the truth, or let Benvolio die.\n\nLADY CAPULET\nHe is a kinsman to the Montague.\nAffection makes him false; he speaks not true.\nSome twenty of them fought in this black strife,\nAnd all those twenty could but kill one life.\nI beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give.\nRomeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.\n\nPRINCE\nRomeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.\nWho now the price of his dear blood doth owe?\n\nMONTAGUE\nNot Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend.\nHis fault concludes but what the law should end,\nThe life of Tybalt.\n\nPRINCE  And for that offense\nImmediately we do exile him hence.\nI have an interest in your hearts' proceeding:\nMy blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.\nBut I'll amerce you with so strong a fine\nThat you shall all repent the loss of mine.\nI will be deaf to pleading and excuses.\nNor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.\nTherefore use none.

Heaven is here\nWhere Juliet lives, and every cat and dog\nAnd little mouse, every unworthy thing,\nLive here in heaven and may look on her,\nBut Romeo may not. More validity,\nMore honorable state, more courtship lives\nIn carrion flies than Romeo.

I like it not.\n\nPARIS\nImmoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,\nAnd therefore have I little talk of love,\nFor Venus smiles not in a house of tears.\nNow, sir, her father counts it dangerous\nThat she do give her sorrow so much sway,\nAnd in his wisdom hastes our marriage\nTo stop the inundation of her tears,\nWhich, too much minded by herself alone,\nMay be put from her by society.\nNow do you know the reason of this haste.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE,\n[aside\n]\nI would I knew not why it should be slowed.--\nLook, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.\n\n[Enter Juliet.\n]\n\n\nPARIS\nHappily met, my lady and my wife.\n\nJULIET\nThat may be, sir, when I may be a wife.\n\nPARIS\nThat \"may be\" must be, love, on Thursday next.\n\nJULIET\nWhat must be shall be.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE  That's a certain text.\n\nPARIS\nCome you to make confession to this father?\n\nJULIET\nTo answer that, I should confess to you.\n\nPARIS\nDo not deny to him that you love me.\n\nJULIET\nI will confess to you that I love him.\n\nPARIS\nSo will you, I am sure, that you love me.\n\nJULIET\nIf I do so, it will be of more price\nBeing spoke behind your back than to your face.\n\nPARIS\nPoor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.\n\nJULIET\nThe tears have got small victory by that,\nFor it was bad enough before their spite.\n\nPARIS\nThou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.\n\nJULIET\nThat is no slander, sir, which is a truth,\nAnd what I spake, I spake it to my face.\n\nPARIS\nThy face is mine, and thou hast slandered it.\n\nJULIET\nIt may be so, for it is not mine own.--\nAre you at leisure, holy father, now,\nOr shall I come to you at evening Mass?\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nMy leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.--\nMy lord, we must entreat the time alone.\n\nPARIS\nGod shield I should disturb devotion!--\nJuliet, on Thursday early will I rouse you.\nTill then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.\t[He exits.\n]\n\nJULIET\nO, shut the door, and when thou hast done so,\nCome weep with me, past hope, past care, past help.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nO Juliet, I already know thy grief.\nIt strains me past the compass of my wits.\nI hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,\nOn Thursday next be married to this County.\n\nJULIET\nTell me not, friar, that thou hearest of this,\nUnless thou tell me how I may prevent it.\nIf in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,\nDo thou but call my resolution wise,\nAnd with this knife I'll help it presently.\n[She shows him her knife.\n]\nGod joined my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;\nAnd ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's sealed,\nShall be the label to another deed,\nOr my true heart with treacherous revolt\nTurn to another, this shall slay them both.\nTherefore out of thy long-experienced time\nGive me some present counsel, or, behold,\n'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife\nShall play the umpire, arbitrating that\nWhich the commission of thy years and art\nCould to no issue of true honor bring.\nBe not so long to speak. I long to die\nIf what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nHold, daughter, I do spy a kind of hope,\nWhich craves as desperate an execution\nAs that is desperate which we would prevent.\nIf, rather than to marry County Paris,\nThou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,\nThen is it likely thou wilt undertake\nA thing like death to chide away this shame,\nThat cop'st with death himself to 'scape from it;\nAnd if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.\n\nJULIET\nO, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,\nFrom off the battlements of any tower,\nOr walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk\nWhere serpents are.

Meager were his looks.\nSharp misery had worn him to the bones.\nAnd in his needy shop a tortoise hung,\nAn alligator stuffed, and other skins\nOf ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves,\nA beggarly account of empty boxes,\nGreen earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,\nRemnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses\nWere thinly scattered to make up a show.\nNoting this penury, to myself I said\n\"An if a man did need a poison now,\nWhose sale is present death in Mantua,\nHere lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.\"\nO, this same thought did but forerun my need,\nAnd this same needy man must sell it me.\nAs I remember, this should be the house.\nBeing holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.--\nWhat ho, Apothecary!\n\n[Enter Apothecary.\n]\n\n\nAPOTHECARY  Who calls so loud?\n\nROMEO\nCome hither, man. I see that thou art poor.\n[He offers money.\n]\nHold, there is forty ducats. Let me have\nA dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear\nAs will disperse itself through all the veins,\nThat the life-weary taker may fall dead,\nAnd that the trunk may be discharged of breath\nAs violently as hasty powder fired\nDoth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.\n\nAPOTHECARY\nSuch mortal drugs I have, but Mantua's law\nIs death to any he that utters them.\n\nROMEO\nArt thou so bare and full of wretchedness,\nAnd fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,\nNeed and oppression starveth in thy eyes,\nContempt and beggary hangs upon thy back.\nThe world is not thy friend, nor the world's law.\nThe world affords no law to make thee rich.\nThen be not poor, but break it, and take this.\n\nAPOTHECARY\nMy poverty, but not my will, consents.\n\nROMEO\nI pay thy poverty and not thy will.\n\nAPOTHECARY,\n[giving him the poison\n]\nPut this in any liquid thing you will\nAnd drink it off, and if you had the strength\nOf twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.\n\nROMEO,\n[handing him the money\n]\nThere is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,\nDoing more murder in this loathsome world\nThan these poor compounds that thou mayst not\nsell.\nI sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.\nFarewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh.\n[Apothecary exits.\n]\nCome, cordial and not poison, go with me\nTo Juliet's grave, for there must I use thee.\n[He exits.\n]\n\nScene 2\n=======\n[Enter Friar John.\n]\n\n\nFRIAR JOHN\nHoly Franciscan friar, brother, ho!\n\n[Enter Friar Lawrence.\n]\n\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nThis same should be the voice of Friar John.--\nWelcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?\nOr, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.\n\nFRIAR JOHN\nGoing to find a barefoot brother out,\nOne of our order, to associate me,\nHere in this city visiting the sick,\nAnd finding him, the searchers of the town,\nSuspecting that we both were in a house\nWhere the infectious pestilence did reign,\nSealed up the doors and would not let us forth,\nSo that my speed to Mantua there was stayed.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nWho bare my letter, then, to Romeo?\n\nFRIAR JOHN\nI could not send it--here it is again--\n[Returning the letter.\n]\nNor get a messenger to bring it thee,\nSo fearful were they of infection.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nUnhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,\nThe letter was not nice but full of charge,\nOf dear import, and the neglecting it\nMay do much danger. Friar John, go hence.\nGet me an iron crow and bring it straight\nUnto my cell.\n\nFRIAR JOHN\nBrother, I'll go and bring it thee.\t[He exits.\n]\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nNow must I to the monument alone.\nWithin this three hours will fair Juliet wake.\nShe will beshrew me much that Romeo\nHath had no notice of these accidents.\nBut I will write again to Mantua,\nAnd keep her at my cell till Romeo come.\nPoor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!\n[He exits.\n]\n\nScene 3\n=======\n[Enter Paris and his Page.\n]\n\n\nPARIS\nGive me thy torch, boy. Hence and stand aloof.\nYet put it out, for I would not be seen.\nUnder yond yew trees lay thee all along,\nHolding thy ear close to the hollow ground.\nSo shall no foot upon the churchyard tread\n(Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)\nBut thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me\nAs signal that thou hearest something approach.\nGive me those flowers. Do as I bid thee. Go.\n\nPAGE,\n[aside\n]\nI am almost afraid to stand alone\nHere in the churchyard. Yet I will adventure.\n[He moves away from Paris.\n]\n\nPARIS,\n[scattering flowers\n]\nSweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew\n(O woe, thy canopy is dust and stones!)\nWhich with sweet water nightly I will dew,\nOr, wanting that, with tears distilled by moans.\nThe obsequies that I for thee will keep\nNightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.\n[Page whistles.\n]\nThe boy gives warning something doth approach.\nWhat cursed foot wanders this way tonight,\nTo cross my obsequies and true love's rite?\nWhat, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile.\n[He steps aside.\n]\n\n[Enter Romeo and Balthasar.\n]\n\n\nROMEO\nGive me that mattock and the wrenching iron.\nHold, take this letter. Early in the morning\nSee thou deliver it to my lord and father.\nGive me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,\nWhate'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof\nAnd do not interrupt me in my course.\nWhy I descend into this bed of death\nIs partly to behold my lady's face,\nBut chiefly to take thence from her dead finger\nA precious ring, a ring that I must use\nIn dear employment. Therefore hence, begone.\nBut, if thou, jealous, dost return to pry\nIn what I farther shall intend to do,\nBy heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint\nAnd strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.\nThe time and my intents are savage-wild,\nMore fierce and more inexorable far\nThan empty tigers or the roaring sea.\n\nBALTHASAR\nI will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.\n\nROMEO\nSo shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.\n[Giving money.\n]\nLive and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow.\n\nBALTHASAR,\n[aside\n]\nFor all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.\nHis looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.\n[He steps aside.\n]\n\nROMEO,\n[beginning to force open the tomb\n]\nThou detestable maw, thou womb of death,\nGorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,\nThus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,\nAnd in despite I'll cram thee with more food.\n\nPARIS\nThis is that banished haughty Montague\nThat murdered my love's cousin, with which grief\nIt is supposed the fair creature died,\nAnd here is come to do some villainous shame\nTo the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.\n[Stepping forward.\n]\nStop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague.\nCan vengeance be pursued further than death?\nCondemned villain, I do apprehend thee.\nObey and go with me, for thou must die.\n\nROMEO\nI must indeed, and therefore came I hither.\nGood gentle youth, tempt not a desp'rate man.\nFly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone.\nLet them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,\nPut not another sin upon my head\nBy urging me to fury. O, begone!\nBy heaven, I love thee better than myself,\nFor I come hither armed against myself.\nStay not, begone, live, and hereafter say\nA madman's mercy bid thee run away.\n\nPARIS\nI do defy thy commination\nAnd apprehend thee for a felon here.\n\nROMEO\nWilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!\n[They draw and fight.\n]\n\nPAGE\nO Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.\n[He exits.\n]\n\nPARIS\nO, I am slain! If thou be merciful,\nOpen the tomb; lay me with Juliet.\t[He dies.\n]\n\nROMEO\nIn faith, I will.--Let me peruse this face.\nMercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!\nWhat said my man when my betossed soul\nDid not attend him as we rode? I think\nHe told me Paris should have married Juliet.\nSaid he not so? Or did I dream it so?\nOr am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,\nTo think it was so?--O, give me thy hand,\nOne writ with me in sour misfortune's book!\nI'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.--\n[He opens the tomb.\n]\nA grave? O, no. A lantern, slaughtered youth,\nFor here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes\nThis vault a feasting presence full of light.--\nDeath, lie thou there, by a dead man interred.\n[Laying Paris in the tomb.\n]\nHow oft when men are at the point of death\nHave they been merry, which their keepers call\nA light'ning before death! O, how may I\nCall this a light'ning?--O my love, my wife,\nDeath, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath,\nHath had no power yet upon thy beauty.\nThou art not conquered. Beauty's ensign yet\nIs crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,\nAnd death's pale flag is not advanced there.--\nTybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?\nO, what more favor can I do to thee\nThan with that hand that cut thy youth in twain\nTo sunder his that was thine enemy?\nForgive me, cousin.--Ah, dear Juliet,\nWhy art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe\nThat unsubstantial death is amorous,\nAnd that the lean abhorred monster keeps\nThee here in dark to be his paramour?\nFor fear of that I still will stay with thee\nAnd never from this palace of dim night\nDepart again. Here, here will I remain\nWith worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here\nWill I set up my everlasting rest\nAnd shake the yoke of inauspicious stars\nFrom this world-wearied flesh! Eyes, look your last.\nArms, take your last embrace. And, lips, O, you\nThe doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss\nA dateless bargain to engrossing death.\n[Kissing Juliet.\n]\nCome, bitter conduct, come, unsavory guide!\nThou desperate pilot, now at once run on\nThe dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!\nHere's to my love. [Drinking.\n] O true apothecary,\nThy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.\n[He dies.\n]\n\n[Enter Friar Lawrence with lantern, crow, and spade.\n]\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nSaint Francis be my speed! How oft tonight\nHave my old feet stumbled at graves!--Who's there?\n\nBALTHASAR\nHere's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nBliss be upon you. Tell me, good my friend,\nWhat torch is yond that vainly lends his light\nTo grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,\nIt burneth in the Capels' monument.\n\nBALTHASAR\nIt doth so, holy sir, and there's my master,\nOne that you love.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE  Who is it?\n\nBALTHASAR  Romeo.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nHow long hath he been there?\n\nBALTHASAR  Full half an hour.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nGo with me to the vault.\n\nBALTHASAR  I dare not, sir.\nMy master knows not but I am gone hence,\nAnd fearfully did menace me with death\nIf I did stay to look on his intents.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nStay, then. I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.\nO, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.\n\nBALTHASAR\nAs I did sleep under this yew tree here,\nI dreamt my master and another fought,\nAnd that my master slew him.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE,\n[moving toward the tomb\n]\nRomeo!--\nAlack, alack, what blood is this which stains\nThe stony entrance of this sepulcher?\nWhat mean these masterless and gory swords\nTo lie discolored by this place of peace?\nRomeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?\nAnd steeped in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour\nIs guilty of this lamentable chance!\nThe lady stirs.\n\nJULIET\nO comfortable friar, where is my lord?\nI do remember well where I should be,\nAnd there I am. Where is my Romeo?\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nI hear some noise.--Lady, come from that nest\nOf death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.\nA greater power than we can contradict\nHath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.\nThy husband in thy bosom there lies dead,\nAnd Paris, too. Come, I'll dispose of thee\nAmong a sisterhood of holy nuns.\nStay not to question, for the watch is coming.\nCome, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.\n\nJULIET\nGo, get thee hence, for I will not away.\n[He exits.\n]\nWhat's here? A cup closed in my true love's hand?\nPoison, I see, hath been his timeless end.--\nO churl, drunk all, and left no friendly drop\nTo help me after! I will kiss thy lips.\nHaply some poison yet doth hang on them,\nTo make me die with a restorative.\t[She kisses him.\n]\nThy lips are warm!\n\n[Enter Paris's Page and Watch.\n]\n\n\nFIRST WATCH  Lead, boy. Which way?\n\nJULIET\nYea, noise? Then I'll be brief. O, happy dagger,\nThis is thy sheath. There rust, and let me die.\n[She takes Romeo's dagger, stabs herself, and dies.\n]\n\nPAGE\nThis is the place, there where the torch doth burn.\n\nFIRST WATCH\nThe ground is bloody.--Search about the\nchurchyard.\nGo, some of you; whoe'er you find, attach.\n[Some watchmen exit.\n]\nPitiful sight! Here lies the County slain,\nAnd Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,\nWho here hath lain this two days buried.--\nGo, tell the Prince. Run to the Capulets.\nRaise up the Montagues. Some others search.\n[Others exit.\n]\nWe see the ground whereon these woes do lie,\nBut the true ground of all these piteous woes\nWe cannot without circumstance descry.\n\n[Enter Watchmen with Romeo's man Balthasar.\n]\n\n\nSECOND WATCH\nHere's Romeo's man. We found him in the\nchurchyard.\n\nFIRST WATCH\nHold him in safety till the Prince come hither.\n\n[Enter Friar Lawrence and another Watchman.\n]\n\n\nTHIRD WATCH\nHere is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.\nWe took this mattock and this spade from him\nAs he was coming from this churchyard's side.\n\nFIRST WATCH\nA great suspicion. Stay the Friar too.\n\n[Enter the Prince with Attendants.\n]\n\n\nPRINCE\nWhat misadventure is so early up\nThat calls our person from our morning rest?\n\n[Enter Capulet and Lady Capulet.\n]\n\n\nCAPULET\nWhat should it be that is so shrieked abroad?\n\nLADY CAPULET\nO, the people in the street cry \"Romeo,\"\nSome \"Juliet,\" and some \"Paris,\" and all run\nWith open outcry toward our monument.\n\nPRINCE\nWhat fear is this which startles in our ears?\n\nFIRST WATCH\nSovereign, here lies the County Paris slain,\nAnd Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before,\nWarm and new killed.\n\nPRINCE\nSearch, seek, and know how this foul murder\ncomes.\n\nFIRST WATCH\nHere is a friar, and slaughtered Romeo's man,\nWith instruments upon them fit to open\nThese dead men's tombs.\n\nCAPULET\nO heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!\nThis dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house\nIs empty on the back of Montague,\nAnd it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom.\n\nLADY CAPULET\nO me, this sight of death is as a bell\nThat warns my old age to a sepulcher.\n\n[Enter Montague.\n]\n\n\nPRINCE\nCome, Montague, for thou art early up\nTo see thy son and heir now early down.\n\nMONTAGUE\nAlas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.\nGrief of my son's exile hath stopped her breath.\nWhat further woe conspires against mine age?\n\nPRINCE  Look, and thou shalt see.\n\nMONTAGUE,\n[seeing Romeo dead\n]\nO thou untaught! What manners is in this,\nTo press before thy father to a grave?\n\nPRINCE\nSeal up the mouth of outrage for awhile,\nTill we can clear these ambiguities\nAnd know their spring, their head, their true\ndescent,\nAnd then will I be general of your woes\nAnd lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,\nAnd let mischance be slave to patience.--\nBring forth the parties of suspicion.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nI am the greatest, able to do least,\nYet most suspected, as the time and place\nDoth make against me, of this direful murder.\nAnd here I stand, both to impeach and purge\nMyself condemned and myself excused.\n\nPRINCE\nThen say at once what thou dost know in this.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nI will be brief, for my short date of breath\nIs not so long as is a tedious tale.\nRomeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,\nAnd she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.\nI married them, and their stol'n marriage day\nWas Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death\nBanished the new-made bridegroom from this city,\nFor whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.\nYou, to remove that siege of grief from her,\nBetrothed and would have married her perforce\nTo County Paris. Then comes she to me,\nAnd with wild looks bid me devise some mean\nTo rid her from this second marriage,\nOr in my cell there would she kill herself.\nThen gave I her (so tutored by my art)\nA sleeping potion, which so took effect\nAs I intended, for it wrought on her\nThe form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo\nThat he should hither come as this dire night\nTo help to take her from her borrowed grave,\nBeing the time the potion's force should cease.\nBut he which bore my letter, Friar John,\nWas stayed by accident, and yesternight\nReturned my letter back. Then all alone\nAt the prefixed hour of her waking\nCame I to take her from her kindred's vault,\nMeaning to keep her closely at my cell\nTill I conveniently could send to Romeo.\nBut when I came, some minute ere the time\nOf her awakening, here untimely lay\nThe noble Paris and true Romeo dead.\nShe wakes, and I entreated her come forth\nAnd bear this work of heaven with patience.\nBut then a noise did scare me from the tomb,\nAnd she, too desperate, would not go with me\nBut, as it seems, did violence on herself.\nAll this I know, and to the marriage\nHer nurse is privy. And if aught in this\nMiscarried by my fault, let my old life\nBe sacrificed some hour before his time\nUnto the rigor of severest law.\n\nPRINCE\nWe still have known thee for a holy man.--\nWhere's Romeo's man? What can he say to this?\n\nBALTHASAR\nI brought my master news of Juliet's death,\nAnd then in post he came from Mantua\nTo this same place, to this same monument.\nThis letter he early bid me give his father\nAnd threatened me with death, going in the vault,\nIf I departed not and left him there.\n\nPRINCE\nGive me the letter. I will look on it.--\n[He takes Romeo's letter.\n]\nWhere is the County's page, that raised the\nwatch?--\nSirrah, what made your master in this place?\n\nPAGE\nHe came with flowers to strew his lady's grave\nAnd bid me stand aloof, and so I did.\nAnon comes one with light to ope the tomb,\nAnd by and by my master drew on him,\nAnd then I ran away to call the watch.\n\nPRINCE\nThis letter doth make good the Friar's words,\nTheir course of love, the tidings of her death;\nAnd here he writes that he did buy a poison\nOf a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal\nCame to this vault to die and lie with Juliet.\nWhere be these enemies?--Capulet, Montague,\nSee what a scourge is laid upon your hate,\nThat heaven finds means to kill your joys with love,\nAnd I, for winking at your discords too,\nHave lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punished.\n\nCAPULET\nO brother Montague, give me thy hand.\nThis is my daughter's jointure, for no more\nCan I demand.\n\nMONTAGUE  But I can give thee more,\nFor I will ray her statue in pure gold,\nThat whiles Verona by that name is known,\nThere shall no figure at such rate be set\nAs that of true and faithful Juliet.\n\nCAPULET\nAs rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie,\nPoor sacrifices of our enmity.\n\nPRINCE\nA glooming peace this morning with it brings.\nThe sun for sorrow will not show his head.\nGo hence to have more talk of these sad things.\nSome shall be pardoned, and some punished.\nFor never was a story of more woe\nThan this of Juliet and her Romeo.\n[All exit.\n]\n"
